  abstract = {Buy now, pay later (BNPL) is a new, increasingly popular form of short-term credit used for everyday items. While critics are concerned that these typically unregulated products pose risks for financially vulnerable people, many BNPL companies argue their app-based products are more responsible than other forms of credit. In this study, I use Davis' (2020) mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances and Light et al.'s (2018) walkthrough method to analyse how three popular BNPL products (Afterpay, Klarna and Zip) define responsible lending and spending. I argue these BNPL companies claim they are more responsible than credit cards because they are more inclusive and have fairer loan terms, and that these claims are made possible by the platformed nature of BNPL products. At the same time, these BNPL companies define responsible consumers as those who make their repayments on time. This redefinition of responsible consumption encourages increased spending and normalises the use of BNPL credit for that consumption. These products, which challenge traditional regulatory responses to consumer credit, are disproportionately used by lower-income families, who are increasingly reliant on credit for everyday purchases.},

Thus, apart from using LinkedIn as a recruitment tool, professionals also use it to make evaluative inferences regarding the individual characteristics of the candidates (e.g., their personality). However, most of the research focused on LinkedIn has left aside the evidence about its validity for decision making in the work setting. In our study we analyze the criterion oriented validity of LinkedIn incumbents professional profiles (N = 615) in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector with some measures of job performance. The results show four major factors underlying LinkedIn profiles about professional experience, social capital, updating knowledge, and non-profesional information. These factors are significantly related to productivity, absenteeism, and the potential for professional development. These findings are discussed in light of their theoretical and practical implications.},

We advance the notion that, in contemporary society, scientific forms of cultural and social capital can command a high symbolic and exchange value. Our previous research [Archer et al. (2014)                 Journal of Research in Science Teaching                 51, 1{\textendash}30] proposed the concept of ``science capital'' (science-related forms of cultural and social capital) as a theoretical lens for explaining differential patterns of aspiration and educational participation among young people. Here, we attempt to theoretically, methodologically, and empirically advance a discussion of how we might conceptualize science capital and how this might be translated into a survey tool for use with students. We report on findings from a survey conducted with 3658 secondary school students, aged 11{\textendash}15 years, in England. Analysis found that science capital was unevenly spread across the student population, with 5\% being classified as having ``high'' science capital and 27\% ``low'' science capital. Analysis shows that levels of science capital (high, medium, or low) are clearly patterned by cultural capital, gender, ethnicity, and set (track) in science. Students with high, medium, or low levels of science capital also seem to have very different post-16 plans (regarding studying or working in science) and different levels of self-efficacy in science. They also vary dramatically in terms of whether they feel others see them as a ``science person.'' The paper concludes with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues and implications for practice. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {Automated hiring algorithms are increasingly used in computing job recruitment. Prior work has examined perceptions of algorithmic fairness and established bias in hiring algorithms, but there is limited work on the ability of computer science students, who are applying for their first computing job, to overcome new barriers posed by automated hiring. To investigate what challenges students face, how they work through them, and their perceptions of these systems, we conducted semi-structured interviews with postsecondary students who were first-time computing job applicants. Analyses revealed that participants had diverse knowledge of hiring algorithms; some people knew to use strategies, such as keywords in resumes, online assessment practice, and referrals to circumvent automated processes to progress to in-person interviews, but others were entirely unaware of the automation. Participants also expressed that current systems prevented them from demonstrating the full extent of their skills and attributed job offers to personal contacts within the company. While some deemed automation a "necessary evil" to combat scale, many struggled with the inequity automated hiring processes perpetuated. Understanding student experiences and perspectives with automated hiring has relevance for how current computer science curricula prepares students for the transition to computing jobs post-graduation. Our findings have implications for how to develop new practices to better support students in their transitions amid a changing hiring landscape.},

However, several critics have raised concerns that whiteboard interviews can cause excessive stress and cognitive load on candidates, ultimately reinforcing bias in hiring practices. Unfortunately, many sensors used for measuring cognitive state are not robust to movement. In this paper, we describe an approach where we use a head-mounted eye-tracker and computer vision algorithms to collect robust metrics of cognitive state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we study two proposed interview settings: on the whiteboard and on paper with 11 participants. Our preliminary results suggest that the whiteboard setting pressures candidates into keeping shorter attention lengths and experiencing higher levels of cognitive load compared to solving the same problems on paper. For instance, we observed 60ms shorter fixation durations and 3x more regressions when solving problems on the whiteboard. Finally, we describe a vision for creating a more inclusive technical interview process through future studies of interventions that lower cognitive load and stress.},

We found that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational, and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. We found that this overhead influenced online freelancers' participation and perceptions of online freelancing over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers employed to manage their careers. Our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms can afford unique career development opportunities over a longer period of time, including career exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation, and skills transfer. Based on our findings, we present policy and design implications to increase the sustainability and accessibility of online freelancing.},

By pairing longitudinal surveys of Facebook users with logs of their online behavior, we examine how communication with different kinds of ties predicts improvements in stress, social support, bridging social capital, and whether they find new jobs. Losing a job is associated with increases in stress, while talking with strong ties is generally associated with improvements in stress and social support. Weak ties do not provide these benefits. Bridging social capital comes from both strong and weak ties. Surprisingly, individuals who have lost a job feel greater stress after talking with strong ties. Contrary to the ``strength of weak ties'' hypothesis, communication with strong ties is more predictive of finding employment within three months.},

However, in practice, the process of looking for work is often embedded in local workforce development ecosystems, where networks of organizations provide a range of services, from employment consulting, to resume workshops, to job skills training programs. Although prior CSCW work has explored the role of algorithms in social services, there has been little work investigating how algorithmic systems may shape workforce development professionals' interactions with clients and how they might be better designed to complement these professionals' work and responsibilities. To begin to address this gap, we conducted an interview study with five workforce development professionals in the US in both management and client-facing roles. Our findings contribute to research on how algorithmic systems are shaping workforce development, shedding light on the importance of the relationship building work that workforce professionals engage in with clients, the difficulty in maintaining boundaries in the face of resource and information challenges, and the ways that workforce development technologies are shaping the work of workforce development.

While many of our results mirrored those of the U.S., we found that the tool was especially beneficial for non-French speaking immigrants who needed support describing their skills outside of their native language. We also found that listing skills like ``active listening'' without important context was insufficient and risked hiding key skills and meaning behind those skills to employers. Taking these factors into account, we illustrate the design implications of our findings and directions for practitioners who wish to design employment tools in support of job seekers, especially those who have traditionally been excluded from the labor market. We then provide insight into the potential for unintended consequences as a result of focusing solely on skills in a post-COVID labor market and contribute ways to mitigate them.},

Through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. These evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. By reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. Given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. We conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process.},

We address this question by interviewing upper-middle-class (UMC) and working- and middle-class (WMC) Computer Science Ph.D. students at prestigious universities who are applying for lucrative internships at established technology companies. We find that while these students are aware of and have access to the "same" resources (e.g., social connections and insider knowledge about employers' expectations), the tactics they use to act on these resources and their emotional experience of the hiring process vary along social class lines. In short, the class-based norms of UMC applicants align with those of employers. The majority of WMC applicants, however, discuss experiencing tension between their class-based norms and employers' dominant values. In contrast to their UMC counterparts, these applicants report spending substantial amounts of time preparing for the hiring process and describe the hiring process as emotionally draining. This research provides insight into the emotional burdens facing even the most privileged WMC applicants. Our findings also have implications for how organizations should take into account social class backgrounds in their hiring practices.},

  abstract = {Individuals' social class background shapes their life experiences and outcomes, including their familial upbringing and educational attainment. However, we know little about how social class background influences the hiring practices of professional settings, and specifically, the ways in which evaluators conceptualize a potential link between social class background and hiring. Through interviewing 50 evaluators at large technology companies, we find that only 19 of them discussed how social class background affects applicants' access to resources, and none articulated the ties between social class background and preferred interpersonal interactional styles. This is particularly troubling because all evaluators described assessing the key hiring criteria of "innovation potential" based on whether applicants display what we term a "transboundary interactional style." This style involves demonstrating an ease with articulating cross-disciplinary ideas as well as facilitating back-and-forth scholarly conversations and debates. While evaluators characterized this style as stemming from applicants' individual personalities, we draw on past sociological literature to suggest that this style is also cultivated in upper-middle-class environments. Given technology companies' expressed desire to hire a diverse workforce by minimizing biases in evaluators' assessments, we conclude with ideas for evaluators to develop more equitable hiring practices.},

Platform power inheres in companies of economic scale that provide the terms of access through which large numbers of consumers access goods, services, and information. Firms with platform power benefit from a deference from policymakers, but this deference is not primarily a function of direct influence through lobbying or campaign contributions, nor does it come from the threat of disinvestment. Companies with platform power instead benefit from the tacit allegiance of consumers, who can prove a formidable source of opposition to regulations that threaten these platforms. Focusing on the critical role played by consumers in explaining the powers platform firms wield in the rich democracies lends insight as well into their distinctive vulnerabilities, which flow from events that split the consumer?platform alliance or that cue citizen, as opposed to consumer, political identities.},

  abstract = {The field of machine learning (ML) has long struggled with a principles-to-practice gap, whereby careful codes and commitments dissipate on their way to practical application. The present work bridges this gap through an applied affordance framework. `Affordances' are how the features of a technology shape, but do not determine, the functions and effects of that technology. Here, I demonstrate the value of an affordance framework as applied to ML, considering ML systems through the prism of design studies. Specifically, I apply the mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances, which models the way technologies request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow technical and social outcomes. Illustrated through three case examples across work, policing, and housing justice, the mechanisms and conditions framework reveals the social nature of technical choices, clarifying how and for whom those choices manifest. This approach displaces vagaries and general claims with the particularities of systems in context, empowering critically minded practitioners while holding power{\textemdash}and the systems power relations produce{\textemdash}to account. More broadly, this work pairs the design studies tradition with the ML domain, setting a foundation for deliberate and considered (re)making of sociotechnical futures.},

With the advent of social media, networking opportunities have expanded to a new set of technology-based methods. However, very little is known about the benefits of using such social networking platforms, especially LinkedIn, which was designed for professional purposes. Integrating research on networking and careers with research on social networking sites, we introduce a model relating extraversion and protean career orientation via networking ability to social networking site usage (i.e., number of contacts and frequency of usage) and a variety of career benefits (e.g., career sponsorship). Using a mixed-mode survey, data were collected from 322 working professionals enrolled in business-related graduate programs, of which 133 used LinkedIn as their predominant professional networking tool. In addition, a subset of the sample using LinkedIn granted us permission to access their LinkedIn profile, which we coded for nine characteristics. In general, data from the survey responses as well as the LinkedIn profiles supported the proposed model. Results also showed that it was not the number of contacts one had, but the frequency of usage, that mattered for the receipt of career benefits.},

In particular, social media provide multiple platforms on which the self may be presented, expand the role other individuals can play in one's own self-presentation, and expand the audience while often simultaneously providing less information about who is in that audience. This paper presents an affordancebased approach to self-presentation on social media platforms rooted in these three challenges and presents a systematic taxonomy for considering aspects of platforms that affect self-presentation. Results from an exploratory study of 193 users suggest significant variation in user perception of our proposed affordances across social media platforms, participant experience levels, and participant personality traits.},

This particularly disadvantages socially and economically marginalized job seekers who are already being pushed into lower-wage precarious work with increasing levels of job insecurity. While the number of employment support tools that match job seekers to employers has been growing, marginalized job seekers still significantly rely on physical employment centers that have a track record of supporting the specific needs associated with marginalization and economic constraints. We drew from prior HCI and CSCW literature uncovering the employment and technology-related challenges that marginalized job seekers face and from the Psychology of Working Theory to frame our research questions and results. To complement this prior work, we investigated how employment center staff work with marginalized job seekers and moderate factors to securing decent work. We found in an interview of 21 employment center staff{\textemdash}career advisors and business services coordinators{\textemdash}that they performed significant work to prepare and encourage marginalized job seekers in applying to positions, while also training employers to be more inclusive and openminded. Career advisors worked directly with job seekers to connect them with external resources, provide encouragement, strategize long-term goals, and mitigate feelings of stigma. Business services coordinators worked directly with employers to prepare job positions and employee support programs. Drawing from the expertise of employment centers, we contribute a framework for designing employment support tools that better serve the needs of marginalized job seekers, and outline tangible design implications that complement the support these organizations provide.

One term in particular, `platform', reveals the contours of this discursive work. The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical `platforms', sometimes as `platforms' from which to speak, sometimes as `platforms' of opportunity.Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided.The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged.},

The general self-presentation goal to appear favorably to others motivates deception when one's true characteristics are inconsistent with their desired impression. Because Linkedin makes resume claims public, deception patterns should be altered relative to traditional resumes. Participants (n=119) in a between-subjects experiment created resumes in one of three resume settings: a traditional (offline) resume, private Linkedin profiles, or publicly available Linkedin profiles. Findings suggest that the public nature of Linkedin resume claims affected the kinds of deception used to create positive impressions, but did not affect the overall frequency of deception. Compared with traditional resumes, Linkedin resumes were less deceptive about the kinds of information that count most to employers, namely an applicant's prior work experience and responsibilities, but more deceptive about interests and hobbies. The results stand in contrast to assumptions that Internet-based communication is more deceptive than traditional formats, and suggests that a framework that considers deception as a resource for self-presentation can account for the findings.},

Using Facebook as a case study, this paper develops a novel methodology for empirically surveying the historical dynamics of social media industry partnerships and partner programs. Facebook is particularly emblematic as one of the few dominant actors that functions both as data aggregator and as digital marketing platform whilst operating a multiplicity of dedicated partner programs that cater to a wide array of industry partners. We employ mixed methods by aligning digital historical research and interview methods: using ``digital methods'', we reconstruct both ongoing and former declared platform{\textendash}industry partnerships and programs with web data whilst conducting semi-structured interviews with selected platform partners to contextualize the empirical research. This enables us to address (i) the dynamic relations between social media platforms and industry partners, (ii) their diversification by catering to a growing number of stakeholders with distinct interests, and (iii) their gradual entrenchment as dominant actors within an emerging digital marketing ecosystem. By tracing how and when partnerships and industry alliances are forged, sustained, and terminated over time we are able to develop a critical account of the political economy of social data that addresses the politics of platforms and stakeholders as well as the consolidation of platform power.},

We used Focused Group Discussion (FGD) method to unmask the perception of 150 respondents from Bangladesh and India who use LinkedIn as professional social networking site frequently. After summarizing the FGD results, it was revealed that LinkedIn is the most preferred source of job search tool among the passive job candidates in terms of all aspects such as information availability, accuracy, relevance, reliability, timeliness and cost effectiveness. In addition, the authors revealed that the participants did not care much about privacy, fairness and ethics on LinkedIn as a professional social networking site (SNS). We expect that the results of this qualitative study will be helpful as a groundwork for further research. We also hope that the results will aid the recruiters to efficiently attract competent passive candidates as well as the job seekers to utilize LinkedIn in finding better job opportunity.},

We performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. We found that ICTs and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants' settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. To support recent immigrants' adaptation, we suggest ways for ICTs to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges.},

The paper analyzes public depictions of Turkopticon which cast designers as creative innovators and AMT workers as without agency or capacity to change their situation. We argue that designers' elevated status as workers in knowledge economies can have practical consequences for the politics of their design work. We explain the consequences of this status for Turkopticon and how we adapted our approach in response over the long term. We argue for analyses of power in design work that account for and develop counters to hegemonic beliefs and practices about design as high-status labor.},

However, lack of both interpersonal trust and a sense of shared identity often prevent low-income individuals from eliciting resources from the diverse networks embedded in these platforms. Building on past research, we investigated factors that facilitated and deterred low-income members of the community-based non-profit organization Family Independence Initiative (FII) from seeking informational and emotional support from other members on the organization's social media platform, UpTogether. We found that despite participants' perceived shared identity, members primarily requested resources from other UpTogether members through offline interactions due to lack of interpersonal trust. We extend existing research on the limitations of shared identity and the role of interpersonal trust and social norms in facilitating resource-seeking interactions among strangers in low-income contexts. We suggest that social media platforms incorporate pseudonymous posting to facilitate relationship development and allow users to disclose their needs without revealing identifying information.},

Aspiring entrepreneurs with limited access to resources and social networks might rely more on the opportunities that social media tools offer. Aspiring entrepreneurs navigate social media to realize their economic dreams. Yet, those who face financial constraints often face challenges. Because aspiring entrepreneurs are transitioning to entrepreneurship, they must construct and even adapt to new work-role identities and new requisite skills, behaviors, attitudes, and patterns of interactions. In a re-analysis of a sub-sample of data from two empirical studies, this work examines how aspiring entrepreneurs living in a financially-constrained environment seek informational, social, and emotional support online and navigate their transition to entrepreneurship. These entrepreneurs obtained informational and emotional resources from observing other members' posts in online communities, including the next steps needed to adapt to their desired small business work roles. However, few publicly disclosed their informational or emotional needs online. We extend existing research on financially-constrained entrepreneurs' use of social media, contributing insights into how these resource-seeking practices limit their exploration of alternative entrepreneurial identities and feedback. We also contribute design implications to facilitate their online disclosure practices, including offering suggestions about ways to respond to questions and other disclosures in ways that restore trust and mitigate identity threats.},

To understand the behaviors and conditions linked to trust, past studies of trust in groups have typically relied on cross-sectional surveys, but these are limited in their ability to identify causation. To better test the potential causal pathways between trust and behaviors or group properties, we paired a two-wave longitudinal survey of 2358 participants in Facebook Groups with logged activity on Facebook. Using latent change score modeling, we examined how trust may predict changes in behavior or group properties and how behaviors and group properties may predict changes in trust. On one hand, people who trust a group tend to contribute more written content to the group over time; and while groups that are more trusted tend to add more administrators and moderators over time, groups that have many administrators and moderators does not tend to be trusted more over time. On the other hand, people's trust in a group increases over time when the group is wellconnected and active overall, while that trust decreases over time when that person is also actively involved in multiple other groups. These findings suggest a positive feedback loop related to active engagement and trust: seeing activity in a group drives trust, which in turn leads to increased individual activity and hence greater overall activity in the group. Overall, trust may be best promoted by encouraging both active engagement and friendship formation.},

Despite this widespread usage, scholarly research that explores its efficacy and the mechanisms for job search success (or failure) in this context is lacking. Accordingly, we rely upon social{\textendash} cognitive theory and self-regulation theory to explore beneficial and adverse outcomes of searching for a job on LinkedIn as well as these outcomes' influence on job search success. Using a multivariate latent change analysis model, our longitudinal data across 2 samples support a self-regulatory frame but not a social{\textendash} cognitive view, suggesting that a change in LinkedIn use for job search is positively related to a subsequent change in ego depletion, which leads to an ensuing adverse change in job search success. Additionally, as opposed to what is predicted by social{\textendash} cognitive theory and typically found in the literature, an increase in job search behavior on LinkedIn was found to lead to poorer job search self-efficacy. In Study 3, we conduct a between-person experiment that explores this finding with results showing that upward social comparisons on LinkedIn lead to lower levels of self-efficacy. In all, the more that individuals use LinkedIn for job search, the worse their job search self-efficacy becomes, the more they become depleted, and the poorer their ensuing job search success. Results suggest some caution should be taken when conducting a job search on LinkedIn.},

We present insights from two qualitative studies: (1) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber drivers and (2) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber riders. Our results show that both drivers and riders acquired and benefited from informational, emotional and instrumental resources, as well as cultural exchanges via interactions with each other and with online platforms. We argue that these interactions could support the development of social and cultural capital. We discuss our findings in the context of labor and contribute design implications for in-car social and cultural experiences and for the ways technologies such as GPS and location-based services can support the additional emotional, social, and cultural labor that drivers provide to their riders.},

First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.},

The use of social media is growing daily and its use in the recruitment process seems to have grown exponentially.Research design, approach and method:~The sample comprised 12 recruiters, spanning a wide range of industries in South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and a thematic analysis was utilised to identify themes and subthemes.Main findings:~Despite still utilising some traditional methods of recruiting, South African recruiters follow their international counterparts, with LinkedIn being central to their respective recruitment processes. The use of Twitter and Facebook for recruitment was found to be substantially lower in South Africa than elsewhere. Without following a focused approach, the volume of work that emanates from using social media may overwhelm a recruiter.Practical and managerial implications:~Recruiters cannot execute effective recruitment without applying social media tools such as LinkedIn. However, training in the optimal use of social media is essential.Contribution:~This study indicates that LinkedIn has a major impact on recruitment in South Africa, but that social media is not a panacea for recruitment issues.},

  abstract = {Software applications (apps) are now prevalent in the digital media environment. They are the site of significant sociocultural and economic transformations across many domains, from health and relationships to entertainment and everyday finance. As relatively closed technical systems, apps pose new methodological challenges for sociocultural digital media research. This article describes a method, grounded in a combination of science and technology studies with cultural studies, through which researchers can perform a critical analysis of a given app. The method involves establishing an app's environment of expected use by identifying and describing its vision, operating model and modes of governance. It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app's intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. The walkthrough also serves as a foundation for further user-centred research that can identify how users resist these arrangements and appropriate app technology for their own purposes.},

  abstract = {Increasingly companies assess a computing candidate's capabilities using technical interviews (TIs). Yet students struggle to code on demand, and there is already an insufficient amount of computing graduates to meet industry needs. Therefore, it is important to understand students' perceptions of TIs, and other professional experiences (e.g., computing jobs). We surveyed 740 undergraduate computing students at three universities to examine their experiences with the hiring process, as well as the impact of professional and cultural experiences (e.g., familial support) on computing identity. We considered the interactions between these experiences and social identity for groups underrepresented in computing {\textemdash}women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx students. Among other findings, we observed that students that did not have positive experiences with TIs had a reduced computing identity, but that facing discrimination during technical interviews had the opposite effect. Social support may play a role. Having friends in computing bolsters computing identity for Hispanic/Latinx students, as does a supportive home environment for women. Also, freelance computing jobs increase computing identity for Black/African American students. Our findings are intended to raise awareness of the best way for educators to help diverse groups of students to succeed, and to inform them of the experiences that may influence students' engagement, resilience, and computing identity development.},

It is also unclear whether or how employers leverage social media in their recruitment of low-wage job seekers, and how social media could better support the needs of both stakeholders. Therefore, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with employers of low-wage workers in the U.S. We found that employers: use social media, primarily Facebook, to access large pools of active low-wage job seekers; and recognize indirect signals about low-wage job seekers' commitment and job readiness. Our work suggests that there remains a visible, yet unaddressed power imbalance between low-wage workers and employers in the use of social media, which risks further destabilizing the precarious labor market.},

The influence of social capital on women's careers has been a concern of researchers, particularly within the contexts of women's underrepresentation in businesses' higher organizational ranks and societal expectations for women. This research builds on previous career studies and improves the understanding of women's career changes with consideration of their social capital behaviors online. The two research questions in the study are: To what degree does online social capital impact women's ability to make desired career changes in business? To what degree do workingwomen view online social networking platforms as a viable means to develop and maintain social capital? In phase one, a quantitative study was conducted via an online survey of over two hundred women working within nearly fifty companies in a southwestern New York and northwestern Pennsylvania region. In phase two, follow-up qualitative questions were asked of an age-stratified sample of women working in the region. The findings suggest that women's use of direct communications channels online is associated with developing and maintaining professional network contacts. Women in the study indicated a limited use and perception of social media tools for developing social capital. Factors including age and field of work were found to impact women's use of social media professionally as well. Future implications suggest investigating the activities women use to develop and maintain their career-related social capital networks over time to identify potential shifts in behavior or social media acceptance.

By surveying 6,383 Facebook Groups users about their trust attitudes and examining aggregated behavioral and demographic data for these individuals, we show that (1) an individual's propensity to trust is associated with how they trust their groups, (2) smaller, closed, older, more exclusive, or more homogeneous groups are trusted more, and (3) a group's overall friendshipnetwork structure and an individual's position within that structure can also predict trust. Last, we demonstrate how group trust predicts outcomes at both individual and group level such as the formation of new friendship ties.},

Moreover, AI practitioners need clarity on what fairness expectations need to be addressed at the AI level. In this paper, we present the evolving AI fairness framework used at LinkedIn to address these three challenges. The framework disentangles AI fairness by separating out equal treatment and equitable product expectations. Rather than imposing a trade-off between these two commonly opposing interpretations of fairness, the framework provides clear guidelines for operationalizing equal AI treatment complemented with a product equity strategy. This paper focuses on the equal AI treatment component of LinkedIn's AI fairness framework, shares the principles that support it, and illustrates their application through a case study. We hope this paper will encourage other big tech companies to join us in sharing their approach to operationalizing AI fairness at scale, so that together we can keep advancing this constantly evolving field.},

The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5-year period, during which 2 billion new ties and 600,000 new jobs were created. The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory. First, the strength of weak ties was nonlinear. Statistical analysis found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point, after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. Second, weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects. Moderately weak ties (measured by mutual connections) and the weakest ties (measured by interaction intensity) created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.},

We also explored the potential for adverse impact associated with this approach of LinkedIn profile assessments and how profile elements are associated with ratings. Results demonstrated that raters can reliably assess personality, cognitive ability, and OCB with one-item measures. LinkedIn showed little promise for valid assessments of personality (except some weak evidence for honestyhumility) and OCB tendencies for all data sources. And, we only found modest evidence of convergent validity for cognitive ability. Automated assessments of personality with Receptiviti were more consistent with raters' assessments than targets' self-reports. LinkedIn-based hiring recommendations did also not differ on the basis of gender, race, or age. Finally, in terms of profile content, longer LinkedIn profiles with more professional connections, more skills listed, or including a professional picture were viewed more positively by both types of raters. But these content elements were largely unrelated to targets' self-reports or test scores. Thus, organizations should be careful when relying on LinkedIn-based assessments of applicants' traits.},

However, a lack of clarity about one's role, that is, one's work responsibilities and degree of authority, can lead to absenteeism, turnover, dissatisfaction, stress, and lower workplace performance. This paper proposes a methodology to quantitatively estimate role ambiguity via unobtrusively gathered data from LinkedIn, shared voluntarily by a cohort of information workers spanning multiple organizations. After successfully validating this LinkedIn based measure of Role Ambiguity, or LibRA against a state-of-the-art gold standard, drawing upon theories in organizational psychology, we examine the efficacy and convergent validity of LibRA in explaining established relationships of role ambiguity with wellbeing and performance measures of individuals. We find that greater LibRA is associated with depleted wellbeing, such as increased heart rate, increased arousal, decreased sleep, and higher stress. In addition, greater LibRA is associated with lower job performance such as decreased organizational citizenship behavior and decreased individual task performance. We discuss how LibRA can help fill gaps in state-of-the-art assessments of role ambiguity, and the potential of this measure in building novel technology-mediated strategies to combat role ambiguity in organizations.},

The existing literature has focused on digital inequality {\`A} workers' unequal access to or skilled use of digital technologies {\`A} but has left unanswered critical questions about the emerging and broad effects of SNS as a labor market intermediary. Drawing on in-depth interviews with unemployed workers this paper describes job seekers' experiences using SNS to look for work. The findings suggest that SNS intermediation of the labor market has two kinds of effects. First, as an intermediary for hiring, SNS produces labor market winners and losers involving filtering processes that often have little to do with evaluations of merit. Second, SNS filtering processes exert new pressures on all workers, whether winners or losers as perceived though this new filter, to manage their careers, and to some extent their private lives, in particular ways that fit the logic of the SNS-mediated labor market.},

Overall, users of LinkedIn and Twitter reported higher informational benefits than non-users, whereas the Facebook users reported lower informational benefits.

  abstract = {The aim of this conceptual article is to provide a framework and a lens for educators in diversifying and making CS education more inclusive. In this article, we conceptualize the notion of computer science capital (CSC), which extends Bourdieu's sociological theory of capital and Archer et~al.'s work on ``science capital.'' The CSC concept was developed by contrasting the concept of science capital with a literature review on key factors affecting students' aspirations in CS. We argue that there is a need to distinguish between science capital and CSC, because the types of capital that are considered legitimate vary between the field of natural science and computer science. The CSC concept uses a sociocultural perspective on learning and can be understood as a form of symbolic capital that is influential in facilitating students' possibility to fully participate in, engage with, and form aspirations in CS. The CSC concept consists of three main components, each with associated subcomponents. We believe our CSC framework, along with the self-reflection prompts included in this article, will offer support for reflections for educators in their daily pedagogical work. By taking students' various levels of social and cultural capital into consideration, educators can plan didactic activities with a focus to strengthen students' various types of capital. This includes reflection on how implicit and explicit norms, beliefs, thoughts, expectations, values, and ideas can affect the pedagogical practices and ultimately the students. Only when we are reflective about our teaching practices can we be better positioned to construct a more inclusive teaching and learning environment.},

  abstract = {Climbing the career ladder to a senior executive position is a long and complex process that, nevertheless, many people are trying to master. Over the last decades, the number of people providing their CVs on professional online social networks, such as LinkedIn is growing. New methods of pattern detection raise the question of whether online CVs provide insights into career patterns and paths. The respective hypothesis is that online CVs map people's careers and therefore build the ideal data set to detect career patterns. To test this hypothesis, 100.006 online CVs were downloaded and preprocessed. This paper presents initial results of one educational and one internship variable. Whereas a higher degree positively predicts career level, having made an internship negatively relates to career level. These results reveal that rather than objectively mirroring people's career trajectories, online career platforms provide selective information. The information of online CVs and the respective career level is intermingled, i.e. people with a high career level present different parts of their careers than people on lower levels. Furthermore, self-presentational effects might have an impact. The effect on similar research and possible implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Research on social networks has grown exponentially in recent years. However, despite its relevance, the field of psychology has been relatively slow to explain the underlying goal pursuit and resistance processes influencing social networks in the first place. In this vein, this article aims to demonstrate how a dynamic network theory perspective explains the way in which social networks influence these processes and related outcomes, such as goal achievement, performance, learning, and emotional contagion at the interpersonal level of analysis. The theory integrates goal pursuit, motivation, and conflict conceptualizations from psychology with social network concepts from sociology and organizational science to provide a taxonomy of social network role behaviors, such as goal striving, system supporting, goal preventing, system negating, and observing. This theoretical perspective provides psychologists with new tools to map social networks (e.g., dynamic network charts), which can help inform the development of change interventions. Implications for social, industrial-organizational, and counseling psychology as well as conflict resolution are discussed, and new opportunities for research are highlighted, such as those related to dynamic network intelligence (also known as cognitive accuracy), levels of analysis, methodological/ethical issues, and the need to theoretically broaden the study of social networking and social media behavior.},

Training increases the end-of-program employment rate by 10\% (7 percentage points), and this effect persists for at least twelve months. The available employment, platform use, and job search data suggest that employment effects are explained by workseekers using the platform to acquire information about prospective employers, and perhaps by workseekers accessing referrals and conveying information to prospective employers on the platform.},

Research suggests that job seekers with limited access to Internet technologies are being left behind, while those with limited social resources are expected to rely on the Internet even more. In this work, we conducted indepth semi-structured interviews with 11 low-resourced job seekers in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States to understand how social and digital resources support their efforts to find work. We find that online resources support job seekers in finding relevant jobs via search, but do not help them identify opportunities to improve their job search process or increase their chances of securing employment. We recommend that systems aiming to support low-resourced job seekers design for deeper engagement with their users across the job search process, to help users recognize ways to improve on their existing practices.},
