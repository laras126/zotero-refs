Focuses on the dual bases of how workplaces afford opportunities for learning and how individuals elect to engage in work activities and with the guidance provided by the workplace. Together, these dual bases for participation (co-participation) at work, and the relations between them, are central to understanding the kinds of learning that workplaces are able to provide and how improving the quality of that learning might proceed. The readiness of the workplace to afford opportunities for individuals to engage in work activities and access direct and indirect support is a key determinant of the quality of learning in workplaces. This readiness can promote individuals' engagement. However, this engagement remains dependent on the degree by which individuals wish to engage purposefully in the workplace.},

Workplaces impose certain expectations and norms in the interest of their own continuity and survival, and in the interest of certain participants; but learners also choose to act in certain ways dependent on their own preferences and goals. Thus, the workplace as a learning environment must be understood as a complex negotiation about knowledge-use, roles and processes --essentially as a question of the learner's participation in situated work activities.},

In addition to outlining positive outcomes, we discuss the challenges of supporting learning within this CoP, particularly with respect to the burden on experts. We discuss potential implications and solutions for the problem of expert scarcity in CoPs, and propose that LPP within fan communities can be leveraged for broadening participation in computing among women.},

In recent years, digital technology has come to play an increasingly important role in enabling informal learning at work through various tools and resources. However, as little empirical research exists on informal learning in this context, more knowledge of digital work practices that promote informal workplace learning is needed. This paper describes a digital ethnography that was conducted to investigate informal learning in authentic work settings. The data were collected from a public sector workplace during the years 2020--2022 and included observations, interviews, and participant diaries, which were analysed using qualitative ethnographic content analysis. This study draws on practice theories to further understand digital work practices and how they are formed in people's daily activities and interactions in the social and material environments of digital technology and work. We present our findings in terms of five practice categories -- workrelated communication, relational communication, sharing, following and listening, and controlling the use of digital technology -- to illustrate how informal learning takes place in everyday work. The detailed accounts of these practices contribute to understanding how digital technology can be used to foster informal learning in work.},

While recent scholarship in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on limiting and eliminating error, practitioners have long used error as a site of collaboration and learning vis-{\`a}-vis labelers, domain experts, and the worlds data scientists seek to model and understand. Drawing from work in CSCW, STS, HCML, and repair studies, as well as from multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork within a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as an edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments. First, error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under 'working' systems. Second, error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors). Third, error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, often through restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise which recenter or devalue the position of different actors. We conclude by discussing how an artful living with error can better support the creative strategies of negotiation and adjustment which data scientists and their collaborators engage in when faced with disruption, breakdown, and friction in their work.},

  abstract = {Female-focused, grassroots communities purporting to help women learn to code are popping up in a variety of settings, indicating the motivation on the part of the participants to evade male-dominated settings while learning. However, little is known about how these groups function as an activity system. With current technology enabling the forming of virtual communities and the meteoric rise in use of the Salesforce CRM (customer relationship management) platform, a group of women have formed a coaching and learning community designed to help women move from Salesforce administrators to software developers through learning to code. We used activity systems analysis (ASA) to investigate this real-world instance of the larger phenomenon using an ethnographic approach. We used ASA to organize and make sense of the data by first creating a table listing the points on the activity system triangle (subject, rules, object, etc.) and filling in the points of the triangle based on the design of the coaching and learning group as described by participants; this gave us a high-level view of the activity system. To understand the subjects' point of view of the system, we then created a new column in the table to fill in themes that emerged from our qualitative data analysis organized by dimension of the activity system. This process enabled us to capture the activity and the voices of participants as well as tensions that had emerged in the system. Findings show a range of outcomes, from participants crediting the group as a kickstart to the journey to successfully landing a job as a developer to members stalling in their progress after involvement. Results also show that purposeful tensions of welcoming novice questions and offering unsolicited verbal encouragement built into the activity system create a welcoming, safe environment for women learning to code.},

  abstract = {College-educated women in the workforce are discovering a latent interest in and aptitude for computing motivated by the prevalence of computing as an integral part of jobs in many fields as well as continued headlines about the number of unfilled, highly paid computing jobs. One of these women's choices for retraining are the so-called coding boot camps that teach programming skills through intensive multi-week courses. This article reports on a qualitative research study focused on the Silicon Valley area of California. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to investigate the larger context surrounding women entering computing professions through boot camp learning sites, including: the               environment               of a booming technology workforce, boot camps as               learning settings               , the               characteristics               of women who attend boot camps, how retraining at a coding boot camp influence women's computing               self-efficacy               and               outcome expectations               , and the               performance attainments               of women at boot camps. Interview data was collected from 14 women who had attended boot camps---first before graduating from the boot camp and again after six months in the workforce. To contextualize the computing ecosystem, we conducted single interviews with 6 boot camp organizers/curriculum developers, 7 industry hiring managers, and 14 university computer science faculty. To provide a contrast with women at boot camps, we interviewed 5 women who majored in computer science at the university and with 17 men who had attended boot camps. Structural data coding and analysis was done focused on the SCCT mechanisms of environment, person inputs, learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and performance attainments. Findings here demonstrate that training at a boot camp can be the catalyst for college-educated women to attain computing jobs and careers, although these entry-level jobs may be a compromise to the goal of a software development job and are unlikely to lead to a job at large, well-known, established technology companies.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses Implementation of a new educational approach to develop competencies for the future STEM workforce, and to build knowledge on success factors for educating a non-traditional target population in data competencies. It is widely accepted that a data capable workforce is critical to science and industry. The literature suggests that the need for data science and data analytics competencies in industry and academia is accelerating at a rapid pace. At the same time, census and demographic data predict that the pool of traditional college age students will continue to decrease. To meet the increasing demand for a data capable workforce, it is essential to leverage the nontraditional student pool, reskilling and upskilling the current workforce, simply because the traditional student output is nowhere near sufficient to meet the need. The current work is to implement a new program designed to provide adult learners with bachelor's degrees and post baccalaureate certificates in Data Analytics. This results in upskilling or reskilling the existing workforce to add value to industry and academia. The program is differentiated from traditional programs by catering to non-traditional students through specific pedagogies such as incorporating required mathematics competencies into Data Analytics courses, using specific pedagogies proven to work with the non-traditional population, as well as removing constraints by offering evening courses, easing registration obstacles, etc. The paper suggests a proposed curriculum, discusses the rationale behind each differentiated option, and explains how the program is being implemented.},

Data science is often described as data-driven, comprising unambiguous data and proceeding through regularized steps of analysis. However, this view focuses more on abstract processes, pipelines, and workflows, and less on how data science workers engage with the data. In this paper, we build on the work of other CSCW and HCI researchers in describing the ways that scientists, scholars, engineers, and others work with their data, through analyses of interviews with 21 data science professionals. We set five approaches to data along a dimension of interventions: Data as given; as captured; as curated; as designed; and as created. Data science workers develop an intuitive sense of their data and processes, and actively shape their data. We propose new ways to apply these interventions analytically, to make sense of the complex activities around data practices.},

When the exhibit elements being tested are intended to support open-ended group exploration and dialogue, existing knowledge-based metrics like measuring the amount of content recalled don't quite apply. Visitor groups can explore the educational content in idiosyncratic ways, meaning that not all groups have the same exposure to content, and the learning arises from the visitors' conversations.

We describe their relationship and argue for their importance. Based on this, we then present the Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum, designed for integration into multiple disciplines and settings.

We also initiate the process of evaluating this curriculum. We create two assessment instruments, one focused on learning and the other on personalization and engagement.

  abstract = {Computer science               (               CS               ) majors are in high demand and account for a large part of national computer and information technology job market applicants. Employment in this sector is projected to grow 12\% between 2018 and 2028, which is faster than the average of all other occupations. Published data are available on traditional non-computer science-specific hiring processes. However, the hiring process for CS majors may be different. It is critical to have up-to-date information on questions such as ``what positions are in high demand for CS majors?,'' ``what is a typical hiring process?,'' and ``what do employers say they look for when hiring CS graduates?'' This article discusses the analysis of a survey of 218 recruiters hiring CS graduates in the United States. We used Atlas.ti to analyze qualitative survey data and report the results on what positions are in the highest demand, the hiring process, and the resume review process. Our study revealed that a software developer was the most common job the recruiters were looking to fill. We found that the hiring process steps for CS graduates are generally aligned with traditional hiring steps, with an additional emphasis on technical and coding tests. Recruiters reported that their hiring choices were based on reviewing resume's experience, GPA, and projects sections. The results provide insights into the hiring process, decision making, resume analysis, and some discrepancies between current undergraduate CS program outcomes and employers' expectations.},

We carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. Among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. However, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. Our findings point to design opportunities in HCI to invent learnercentered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.},

This article presents a qualitative case study that follows five undergraduate biology majors in a computer science course (CS0). This CS0 course teaches programming within a data-driven context and is part of a university-wide initiative to improve students' quantitative scholarship. In this course, students learn computing concepts and computational thinking by writing programs in MATLAB that compute with data, by performing meaningful analyses, and by writing about the results. The goal of the study reported here is to better understand the thought processes students use in such a data-driven approach. Findings show that students engage in an ongoing organizational process to understand the structure of the data. The computational and visualization tasks appear to be closely linked, and the visualization component appears to provide valuable feedback for students in accomplishing the programming tasks.},

  abstract = {Technology innovation requires a set of diverse employees with computing skills. Yet, it remains a challenge for the global digital labor market to obtain an equitable representation of women. This is particularly true for women who enter the computing workforce after obtaining an initial undergraduate degree in a non-computing field. To resolve discrepancies, it is important to learn more about the factors influencing career trajectories and the possible alternative pathways that may encourage participation in the field. We define alternative pathways as any post-baccalaureate program or training that meets the needs of bachelor's degree-holding women with computing aspirations. This research paper, guided by Schlossberg's Transition Theory, conducted a content analysis on publicly available job profiles to characterize the types and features of alternative pathways commonly chosen by women in the United States (U.S.) to aid in understanding their transitions into a computing career. Findings from this study provide guidance and suggestions to women who are interested in transitioning to computing later in their career paths. It further outlines potential avenues with actionable recommendations for the computing education community to attract and retain women in the computing workforce in an effort to build an inclusive ecosystem.},
