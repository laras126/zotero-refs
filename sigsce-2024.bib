At the 21st anniversary of that published vision, I want to assess ubicomp's maturity and explore the identity challenge it faces. Today, ubicomp as a niche research topic no longer makes sense; we must celebrate its ``disappearance'' as a well-scoped research agenda because it has become a profound agenda across most of computing, and beyond. This should not be surprising; the 2nd generation of computing, the personal computer revolution, experienced the same profound disappearance. In celebration of this imminent disappearance, I will highlight the unique contributions of the ubicomp community, express some remaining intellectual challenges, and speculate on how to formulate new visions of computing that might succeed this third generation.},

We explore systemic issues of power to evaluate the multidimensional indicators of Latino health outcomes and how technology can support well-being. Our proposed framework enables designers to gain a better understanding of how marginalized communities use digital technologies to navigate unique challenges. As an innovative and possibly controversial approach to assets-based design, we stress the importance of industry and academia self-reflection on their organization's role in the marginalization of communities in addition to valuing the lived experiences of marginalized communities. Through this approach, designers may avoid amplifying structural and health inequities in marginalized communities.},

It reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the Nairobi Play Project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in Kenya. While the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. Based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. We argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. We also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. We reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in CSCW, ICTD, and allied fields of work.},

Unlike written and drawn practices developed prior to the 20th century, notation for programming computers developed in concert and conflict with discretizing infrastructure such as the shift-key typewriter and data processing pipelines. In this paper, I recall the emergence of high-level notation for representing computation. I show how the earliest inventors of programming notations borrowed from various written cultural practices, some of which came into conflict with the constraints of digitizing machines, most prominently the typewriter. As such, I trace how practices of ``writing code'' were fabricated along social, cultural, and material lines at the time of their emergence. By juxtaposing early visions with the modern status quo, I question long-standing terminology, dichotomies, and epistemological tendencies in the field of computer programming. Finally, I argue that translation work is a fundamental property of the practice of writing code by advancing an intercultural lens on programming practice rooted in history.},

This study examines technical skills required by the leading business and industry employers in the US for the various data analytics fields. Specifically, 50 recent vacancy announcements in five data analytics fields were analyzed for the similarity or adjacency of their skill requirements in order to discover retraining opportunities for employees and graduates to move from one such field to another. Results of data analysis and discussion of the results highlight potential career paths for such transitions.},

Locating these challenges at the intersection of (1) two powerful global discourses of entrepreneurialism and technology upgrade and (2) class frictions and racial dynamics, this paper uncovers ways in which CSCW might support entrepreneurialism in the new economy, particularly given that it is becoming a de facto space of work and mode of living.},

The symbols of the language are the abstractions of the program, and the grammar of the language is the set of (generally unwritten) rules about the allowable combinations of those abstractions. As such, a program is both a language definition, and the only use of that language. This specificity means that reading a never-before encountered program involves learning a new natural language, and that porting code from one program to another requires translation from one natural language into another. We suggest that the complexity and depth of the program language is affected by the gap between the program semantics (what the program is meant to do) and the code semantics (the way in which the machine runs). We believe that in seeing that programs are languages, we gain new insight into our own experience as programmers, and are able to gain new perspective on the intense complexity of code and its creation.},

The rst cluster, called the Weberian literature, emerged in the 1950s when industrial sociologists were actively exploring the implications and limitations of Weber's theory of bureaucracy. The second cluster ascended during the 1970s, drew its inspiration primarily from Marx and later Braverman, and focused on questions about the place of technical occupations in the class structure. This article shows how sociology's tendency to place theory before description has left anemic images of technical work. It lays out a research agenda for the development of substantive knowledge of technical work and its social organization, drawing eclectically on more recent studies that have taken steps toward a more comparative, grounded, situated and emic understanding of what technical work entails.},

  abstract = {End-User Development (EUD), End-Programming (EUP) and End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) are three related research fields that study methods and techniques for empowering end users to modify and create digital artifacts. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying and classifying scientific literature about EUD, EUP and EUSE in the time range January 2000\textendash May 2017. We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human\textendash Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities. However, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. Other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis' dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations.},

The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.},

The confluence of the importance of reflective practices within the educational curriculum and the increased proliferation of technology have resulted in numerous studies of how to use automated approaches to analyze broad themes of reflection exhibited by learners in higher educational settings. However, there is a dearth of research in the context of automated analysis of reflective writing demonstrated by professionals within workplace learning. Building on a four-level reflective content analysis model, this study evaluates the depth of reflection exhibited by learners within a professional development MOOC using an automated assessment classifier. Our results identify the varying association of linguistic features across these different levels of reflection. The proposed approach can effectively support the deployment at scale of the labor-intensive evaluation of reflective writing by highly trained professionals.},

It synthesizes randomized controlled trial evidence from workplace-delivered training for changes in mindfulness, stress, mental health, wellbeing and work performance outcomes. Going beyond extant reviews, this paper explores the influence of variability in workforce and intervention characteristics for reducing perceived stress. Meta-effect estimates (Hedge's g) were computed using data from 23 studies. Results indicate beneficial effects following training for mindfulness (g=0.45, p{$<$}0.001) and stress (g=0.56, p{$<$}0.001); for the mental health indicators anxiety (g=0.62, p{$<$}0.001) and psychological distress (g=0.69, p{$<$}0.001); and for wellbeing (g=0.46, p=0.002) and sleep (g=0.26, p=0.003). No conclusions could be drawn from pooled data for burnout due to ambivalence in results, for depression due to publication bias, or for work performance due to insufficient data. The potential for integrating the construct of mindfulness within demands-resources, coping and prevention theories of work stress is considered in relation to the results. Limitations to study designs and reporting are addressed, and recommendations to advance research in this field are made.},

It is important, therefore, that systems analysts and designers develop expertise in methods for specifying information systems security.

These methods include approaches that use checklists of controls, divide functional requirements into engineering partitions, and create abstract models of both the problem and the solution. Comparisons and contrasts reveal that advances in security methods lag behind advances in general systems development methods. This analysis also reveals that more general methods fail to consider security specifications rigorously.},

We trace the origins of this antithesis to the days of End-User Computing in organizational settings, and argue that modern software development resides in a different paradigm, where end-user Development is part and parcel of any programming endeavour, in professional or other settings. We propose that current development practice, both for those traditionally regarded as end-user and as professional developers, can be better served by EUD as a field, if the focus is shifted to the nature of the task itself, and how technical it needs to be, by way of the platforms that development takes place on.},

However, several critics have raised concerns that whiteboard interviews can cause excessive stress and cognitive load on candidates, ultimately reinforcing bias in hiring practices. Unfortunately, many sensors used for measuring cognitive state are not robust to movement. In this paper, we describe an approach where we use a head-mounted eye-tracker and computer vision algorithms to collect robust metrics of cognitive state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we study two proposed interview settings: on the whiteboard and on paper with 11 participants. Our preliminary results suggest that the whiteboard setting pressures candidates into keeping shorter attention lengths and experiencing higher levels of cognitive load compared to solving the same problems on paper. For instance, we observed 60ms shorter fixation durations and 3x more regressions when solving problems on the whiteboard. Finally, we describe a vision for creating a more inclusive technical interview process through future studies of interventions that lower cognitive load and stress.},

Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language implementation, distributed operating system design, or denotational semantics, are defined largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by contrast, encompasses a wide range of disparate technological areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the future. Ubiquitous computing's vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the field collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the contemporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on crosscultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a ``ubicomp of the present'' which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

Exploratory programming is highly relevant today to a variety of professional and end-user programmer domains, including prototyping, learning through play, digital art, and data science. However, prior research has largely lacked clarity on what exploratory programming is, and what behaviors are characteristic of this practice. Drawing on this data and prior literature, we provide an organized description of what exploratory programming has meant historically and a framework of four dimensions for studying exploratory programming tasks: (1) applications, (2) required code quality, (3) ease or difficulty of exploration, and (4) the exploratory process. This provides a basis for better analyzing tool support for exploratory programming.},

Values of coefficient alpha ranged from .78 to .87 for the 5-level continuum, in contrast to .69 to .83 for the 10-level continuum. Criterion-related validity correlations with career indecision and vocational identity were comparable for the two response continua. Validity with respect to the scales of the Career Decision Profile was examined, as was construct validity with respect to measures of hope, goal stability, and positive and negative affect. Overall, the study suggests the psychometric quality of the CDSE when 5-level response continua are used and adds to knowledge of the nomological network of the construct.               1},

I articulate a theoretical perspective on the `learning activity' in these workplaces using ideas of Engestr\"om and Freire, I focus and problematise the discourse of empowerment and analyse its impact on the learning activity in these organisations focusing on its implications for the worker. I argue that the notion of `Permanent pedagogy' is an essential strategy of NGOs to position the worker in a deficit perspective and trade their services for low employment, low wages, precarious work and often intensive emotional labour. Permanent pedagogy manifests itself at the levels of cultural norms and ethos of a workplace, socio-historical perception and realities of the workplace and individual consciousness. Using the lens of CHAT and Freire's pedagogic model, I identify specific features of the learning activity that operate within the logic of the neoliberal order. I propose an alternative framework of workplace learning that focuses on resistance. The paper intends to stimulate critical reflection amongst NGO practitioners and scholars to question the broader notion of empowerment and, instead advance empirical focus on emancipatory learning structures.},

Workplaces impose certain expectations and norms in the interest of their own continuity and survival, and in the interest of certain participants; but learners also choose to act in certain ways dependent on their own preferences and goals.

Guidance by others, situations, and artifacts are central to learning through work because the knowledge to be learned is historically, culturally, and situationally constituted. However, the quality of learning through these planes of activities and guidance is ultimately premised on the workplace's participatory practices, which shape and distribute the activities and support the workplace affordance workers and fromwhich they learn. Situational and political processes underpin these workplace affordances. Yet participatory practices are reciprocally constructed because individuals elect how to engage in and learn from what workplaces afford them. A workplace pedagogy is founded in these coparticipatory practices and needs to account for how workplaces invite access to activities and guidance and how individuals elect to participate in what the workplace affords.},

Even ``end-user'' programmers in previous studies have often worked in organizations where programming is recognized to be demanding professional work \textendash{} the term ``power-user'' recognizes this technical kudos. But as personal computers become widespread, and most new domestic appliances incorporate microprocessors, many people are engaging in programming-like activities in domestic or non-professional contexts. Such users often have less motivation and more obstacles to programming, meaning that they may be unlikely even to take the first steps. This paper analyses the generic nature of those first steps, and identifies the cognitive demands that characterize them. On the basis of this analysis we propose the Attention Investment model, a cognitive model of programming that offers a consistent account of all programming behaviour, from professionals to end-users.},

We found that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational, and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. We found that this overhead influenced online freelancers' participation and perceptions of online freelancing over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers employed to manage their careers. Our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms can afford unique career development opportunities over a longer period of time, including career exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation, and skills transfer.

The data sets used are the three available cross-sections of Qualification and Career Surveys commissioned by the Federal Institute for Vocational Training and the Research Institute of the Federal Labour Office. For each cross-section we estimate an ordered probit model testing demand (including technological progress) and supply-side factors affecting the applicability of what workers have learned during apprenticeship. Furthermore, we estimate earnings functions with the same specification, testing whether firmspecific and socio-economic factors have the same relevance for applicability and earnings. The results indicate that on-the-job investment in human capital has become more important relative to vocational training. Measures for improving the German dual vocational training system are suggested.},

Issues of flexibility, learning, and quality are subject of much debate, negotiation, and conflict in the Canadian pulp and paper industry. A key bargaining issue for management has been to harness flexibility among the manual craft workers, to improve labour productivity. Within this context, workplace learning is not neutral or independent of day-to-day union-management relations: it is a contested issue. Learning new skills is viewed as a threat to job control and security and presents a paradox: learning new trade skills enhances individual workers' flexibility and employability but collectively weakens the union through job losses. Data were collected from pulp mills in British Columbia between 1996 and 1999. Survey and qualitative data provides evidence that workers' resistance to learning is part of the contested arena of productivity and job control.},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

Results indicate that hiring managers filling positions, generally have a favorable perspective of coding boot camp hires in relation to their demonstration of ``soft'' skills, such as teamwork, passion, and persistence; With regards to four-year university hires, several industry representatives indicated that a four-year degree is mandatory for hire, while also listing a solid understanding of CS principles and substantial exposure to mathematics.

The practice that EUSE research aims to support is end users using new tools and methods to improve the quality of the software that they and other end users have created. There is a need for this outcome because research shows both that the number of end users creating their own software greatly exceeds the number of professional software developers, and that the software they create is riddled with errors. In this paper, we describe the present state of EUSE, and challenges in moving forward toward a bright future. We show how the future of EUSE may become over-siloed, restricting future researchers' vision of what can be achieved. We then show that focusing on the in-the-moment intents of end-user developers can be used to derive a number of promising directions forward for EUSE researchers, and how theories can help us further desilo future EUSE research. Finally, we discuss how overcoming challenges for the future of end-user software engineering may also bring direct benefits to the future of ``classic'' software engineering.},

Its definition and validity however, is contentious. To address this issue, the current study aimed to identify the attributes and characteristics that comprise work readiness and develop a scale to assess graduate work readiness. A qualitative study was conducted to assist in generating a representative pool of items for quantitative measurement. The resultant 167 item Work Readiness Scale (WRS) which we developed was validated in a sample of 251 graduates across a range of disciplines. Item analysis assisted in refining the scale. Exploratory factor analyses supported a four factor solution, with the final WRS consisting of 64 items. The four factors explained 44.7\% of the variance, demonstrated excellent reliability and were labelled personal characteristics, organisational acumen, work competence, and social intelligence.

Traditional coop programs in colleges and universities alternate courses with semesters spent as an intern at a relevant workplace. We have designed an academic-industry partnership that takes work-integrated learning further by deliberately aligning workplace experience to the academic curriculum. Our students earn a Bachelor of Computer Science from the university, and are paid employees of the industry partner throughout their degree. While advanced courses and electives are taken on campus as usual, some core computer science classes and practicum courses are delivered with the industry partner so as to integrate them with placements on site. Assessment remains the responsibility of the university. In this report, we describe the partnership from the perspective of the industry partner. We describe our goals, partnership design, and first two iterations of the implementation. We discuss the challenges we have faced with our first cohort, and share suggestions for others looking to create similar programs.},

For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops, where millions of dollars grow on trees. It's a "Brotopia," where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties. In this powerful expose, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they "won't lower their standards" just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women. Silicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It's time to break up the boys' club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture--to bring down Brotopia, once and for all"--},

This paper presents research conducted as part of a long-term project aimed at designing digital tools to assist communities and formal responders plan and manage emergency shelters. Working with partners in Puerto Rico, we developed and distributed cultural probes in three communities with recent experience of hurricanes and earthquakes to better understand the needs and resources of disaster affected people related to shelter. This approach yielded novel insights that challenge and expand traditional views of emergency shelters and identified several areas where HCI research and design can contribute to the sector.},

Specifically, it is argued that individual behavior is organized with respect to values, attitudes, and beliefs of a reference group, in this case, a cultural reference group. Career development for African Americans then, is conceptualized within a complementary framework termed Africentrism. A heuristic model is advanced for understanding the origins of culturally relevant values some African Americans hold toward work and careerism. Inclusion of these and similar culturally relevant values enables fuller service to this (and all) ethnic minority clients regardless of counselor's theoretical perspectives.},

In Study 1, college students at two U.S. West Coast universities (N=293) provided descriptions of computer science majors. Coding these descriptions revealed that computer scientists were perceived as having traits that are incompatible with the female gender role, such as lacking interpersonal skills and being singularly focused on computers. In Study 2, college students at two U.S. West Coast universities (N=54) read fabricated newspaper articles about computer scientists that either described them as fitting the current stereotypes or no longer fitting these stereotypes. Women who read that computer scientists no longer fit the stereotypes expressed more interest in computer science than those who read that computer scientists fit the stereotypes. In contrast, men's interest in computer science did not differ across articles. Taken together, these studies suggest that stereotypes of academic fields influence who chooses to participate in these fields, and that recruiting efforts to draw more women into computer science would benefit from media efforts that alter how computer scientists are depicted.},

Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the ``programmer's language'' and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

To investigate the existence of such a population of conversational programmers in practice, we surveyed professionals at a large multinational technology company who were not in software development roles. Based on 3151 survey responses from professionals who never or rarely wrote code, we found that a significant number of them (42.6\%) had invested in learning programming on the job. While many of these respondents wanted to perform traditional end-user programming tasks (e.g., data analysis), we discovered that two top motivations for learning programming were to improve the efficacy of technical conversations and to acquire marketable skillsets. The main contribution of this work is in empirically establishing the existence and characteristics of conversational programmers in a large software development context.},

Through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. These evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. By reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. Given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. We conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process.},

However, we know little about how social class background influences the hiring practices of professional settings, and specifically, the ways in which evaluators conceptualize a potential link between social class background and hiring. Through interviewing 50 evaluators at large technology companies, we find that only 19 of them discussed how social class background affects applicants' access to resources, and none articulated the ties between social class background and preferred interpersonal interactional styles. This is particularly troubling because all evaluators described assessing the key hiring criteria of "innovation potential" based on whether applicants display what we term a "transboundary interactional style." This style involves demonstrating an ease with articulating cross-disciplinary ideas as well as facilitating back-and-forth scholarly conversations and debates. While evaluators characterized this style as stemming from applicants' individual personalities, we draw on past sociological literature to suggest that this style is also cultivated in upper-middle-class environments.

In this paper, I develop a model of this process of job design by drawing on a multisite qualitative study of task allocation following the installation of a DNA sequencer. The model that emerges is one of the assembly of tasks through multiple subassembly processes with multiple assemblers. Four activities produced requirements and requests for job designs and propositions about how to meet these: actively searching, passively receiving, doing work, and invoking preexisting ideas. The ideas that emerge from these processes are further transformed through reconciliation, interpretation, and performance. My observations show that this overall process is far reaching and incorporates many elements, not all of which are explicitly intended for job designs. The arrangements that emerge from this process are not the product of a deliberate and controlled job design process within the boundaries of a single organization.},

However, such accounts fail to acknowledge the relationship between learning and identity. Drawing on detailed case studies of three vocational courses \textendash{} in childcare, healthcare and engineering \textendash{} in English further education colleges, within the project Transforming Learning Cultures in Further Education, it is argued that learning is a process of becoming. Learning cultures and the vocational cultures in which they are steeped transform those who enter them. The authors develop the concept of `vocational habitus' to explain a central aspect of students' experience, as they have to orient to a particular set of dispositions \textendash{} both idealised and realised. Predispositions related to gender, family background and specific locations within the working class are necessary, but not sufficient for effective learning. Vocational habitus reinforces and develops these in line with demands of the workplace, although it may reproduce social inequalities at the same time. Vocational habitus involves developing not only a `sense' of how to be, but also `sensibility': requisite feelings and morals, and the capacity for emotional labour.},

Most Schools however, look for specialised educational software and hardware to achieve this integration. This paper proposes the use of a widely readily available tool to achieve the same integration that other specialized tools would achieve. Over the years the application area for spreadsheets has multiplied. It is software that is becoming more pronounced in the teaching and learning of pupils and students. A Spreadsheet can be used as a powerful learning tool for both primary and secondary school pupils. Spreadsheets offer concrete ways to explore abstract concepts in mathematics and other subjects. Spreadsheets contain a variety of formulas, which can be used in teaching mathematics. These formulas can be generalized, so that students can see how the outcome is changed when one of the variables is altered. Apart from using ready-made formulas pupils can make up their own formulas to manipulate numbers. This paper proposes the use of Ms Excel in the teaching and learning of statistics in secondary schools. This paper demonstrates the ability for Ms Excel to teach almost all the topics in secondary school statistics.},

We ofer grounded-truth considerations for the continued design of fn-tech that could have equitable impact among historically marginalized communities. Refecting on the tenor of fnancial services to lack empathy, we urge designers and scholars of fnancial technology to refect on their power to promote racial justice and fnancial inclusion.},

The valorization of non-linguistic behaviours as adding further explanatory power to sociolinguistic models is timely: it has often been implicit in linguistic study (through ethnography) but rarely been given recognition. However, the types of self-constituting communities of interest to sociolinguists are not the same as the communities of learning studied by Lave and Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998). If this construct is to be useful to sociolinguists, then the mechanisms by which it models access, gate-keeping and its internal hierarchy need development. Using Eckert's (2000) Belten High data, and other work on adolescent talk, it is argued that gaining legitimate peripheral participation is a matter of sanction from within the hierarchy. Individuals do not have open access to communities based solely on their desire to be part of that community and to take part in its practices. While practices may define the community, the community determines who has access to that practice.},

  abstract = {Performing arts computing environments have received little attention in the educational sphere; yet, they offer opportunities for learners to validate their efforts, ideas, and skills through showcasing their work in a public-facing performance. In this work, we explore an out-of-school dance and computing educational program run by the organization, STEM From Dance. The organizational mission is to create an equitable learning experience for young women of color to engage with computing while exposing them to STEM careers. Through an analysis of eleven interviews with youth participants, instructors, and the executive director, we examine how the social, cultural, and political dimensions of the learning environment facilitate identity work in computing and dance. Our findings point to three primary activities used by the organization to promote equity: (1) providing psychological safety through a supportive community environment, (2) meaningfully engaging with learners' social and cultural context through creative work with constructionist artifacts, and (3) actively promoting identity work as women of color in computing and STEM through both artifact work and community events. Applying the constructs of identity and psychological safety we explore the tensions and synergies of designing for equity in this performing arts and computing learning environment. We demonstrate how the seemingly contradictory elements of a high-stakes performance within a novice learning environment provides unique opportunities for supporting young women of color in computing, making them non-negotiable in the organization's efforts to promote equity and inclusion. Our work illustrates how attending closely to the sociocultural dimensions in a constructionist learning environment provides lenses for navigating equity, identity work, and support for inclusive computing.},

Based on two public forums held in underserved communities, we describe residents' perceptions of civic technologies in their communities and challenges that limit the technologies' viability. We found that residents viewed civic technology as a tool that should strengthen existing community assets by providing an avenue to connect assets and build upon them. We describe how an asset-based approach can move us toward designing civic technology that develops stronger relationships among community-led initiatives, and between the community and local government--- rather than a data-driven approach to civic tech that focuses on transactions between residents and city services.},

While job seekers from all occupational groups and employment status rely on aspects of the Internet for employment, past research suggests that disadvantaged job seekers are being `left behind' and will continue to be left behind as the Internet takes on a more eminent role in the employment process. To mitigate this outcome, we extended prior literature and took a usercentered design approach to design and implement a webbased employment application that provides job seekers with resume feedback from local volunteers. We piloted our application to understand: 1) the context and circumstances of our application's shortcomings and 2) UX principles that address these shortcomings. We extend employment research that aims to alleviate the negative effects of technological advancement on disadvantaged job seekers.},

However, we identify a pervasive lack of understanding in existing literature, which raises an important research question: how can we build social capital where little social capital exists? We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socioeconomic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities). We also suggest ways in which ICTs can assist populations that could benefit most from increased social capital and economic security.},

This particularly disadvantages socially and economically marginalized job seekers who are already being pushed into lower-wage precarious work with increasing levels of job insecurity. While the number of employment support tools that match job seekers to employers has been growing, marginalized job seekers still significantly rely on physical employment centers that have a track record of supporting the specific needs associated with marginalization and economic constraints. We drew from prior HCI and CSCW literature uncovering the employment and technology-related challenges that marginalized job seekers face and from the Psychology of Working Theory to frame our research questions and results. To complement this prior work, we investigated how employment center staff work with marginalized job seekers and moderate factors to securing decent work. We found in an interview of 21 employment center staff\textemdash career advisors and business services coordinators\textemdash that they performed significant work to prepare and encourage marginalized job seekers in applying to positions, while also training employers to be more inclusive and openminded. Career advisors worked directly with job seekers to connect them with external resources, provide encouragement, strategize long-term goals, and mitigate feelings of stigma. Business services coordinators worked directly with employers to prepare job positions and employee support programs. Drawing from the expertise of employment centers, we contribute a framework for designing employment support tools that better serve the needs of marginalized job seekers, and outline tangible design implications that complement the support these organizations provide.

It is unclear, however, how learners leverage MOOCs for employment and how effectively these platforms support employability. To explore this further, we surveyed 441 learners and interviewed 22 learners motivated to take MOOCs for reasons related to financial limitations and/or reasons related to employment. Using the three dimensions of employability as a framework\textemdash human and social capital, career identity, and personal adaptability\textemdash we find that while most of our participants were optimistic about the potential for MOOCs to improve their employability, there was very limited tangible evidence of employment mobility from taking MOOCs. Though MOOCs support human capital, there are opportunities to further support social capital, career identity, and personal adaptability. We contribute a deeper understanding of learners who use MOOCs for employment and provide concrete design implications for MOOC platforms to better support employability in the future. We found very few low SES learners using MOOCs for reasons of employment and identify opportunities for MOOCs to reach and support these learners.},

The possibilities are intriguing, but as yet not fully understood. One key technique traditionally leveraged by social movements is storytelling. In this paper, we examine the use of collective storytelling online in the context of a social movement organization called Hollaback, an organization working to stop street harassment. Can sharing a story of experienced harassment really make a difference to an individual or a community? Using Emancipatory Action Research and qualitative methods, we interviewed people who contributed stories of harassment online. We found that sharing stories shifted participants' cognitive and emotional orientation towards their experience. The theory of ``framing'' from social movement research explains the surprising power of this experience for Hollaback participants. We contribute a way of looking at activism online using social movement theory. Our work illustrates that technology can help crowd-sourced framing processes that have traditionally been done by social movement organizations.},

This active reflection and considerations of pervious experiences are closely tied to metacognition and a number of learning theories. Exploring previous studies provides examples of how learning theories are enacted through participatory design and how a greater awareness of these theories can inform the practice of participatory design.},

The findings presented will demonstrate that issues of access to CS education go beyond technical means, and include ability to conduct suitable searches and identify appropriate computational learning tools. Out-of-school learning is an important factor in who is motivated and prepared to study computer science in college. It is likely that without early access to informal CS learning, fewer students are motivated to explore CS in formal classrooms.},

Given the fast pace of technology changes and the need for IT professionals to constantly keep up with the field, it is important to analyze the job skills and knowledge required in the data analyst and business intelligence (BI) analyst job market. In this research, we examine over 9,000 job postings for entry-level data analytics jobs over five years (2014-2018). Using a text mining approach and a custom text mining dictionary, we identify a preliminary set of analytic competencies sought in practice. Further, the longitudinal data also demonstrates how these key skills have evolved over time. We find that the three biggest trends include proficiency with Python, Tableau, and R. We also find that an increasing number of jobs emphasize data visualization. Some skills, like Microsoft Access, SAP, and Cognos, declined in popularity over the time frame studied. Using the results of the study, universities can make informed curriculum decisions, and instructors can decide what skills to teach based on industry needs. Our custom text mining dictionary can be added to the growing literature and assist other researchers in this space.},

Our central aim is to explain the work experiences of all individuals, but particularly people near or in poverty, people who face discrimination and marginalization in their lives, and people facing challenging work-based transitions for which contextual factors are often the primary drivers of the ability to secure decent work. The concept of decent work is defined and positioned as the central variable within the theory. A series of propositions is offered concerning (a) contextual predictors of securing decent work, (b) psychological and economic mediators and moderators of these relations, and (c) outcomes of securing decent work. Recommendations are suggested for researchers seeking to use the theory and practical implications are offered concerning counseling, advocacy, and public policy.},

As a consequence of this acceleration, end-user computing (EUC) and end-user development (EUD) have also grown. Definitions of EUC developed in the 1980s continue to be used by contemporary researchers without regard to the changing technological environment, user experience, and user needs. Therefore, the authors challenge traditional definitions of EUC developed and used by researchers to ascertain whether they meet the needs of management for the 21st century. There is a conflict among traditional definitions that has not been addressed since the early 1990s (Downey \& Bartczak, 2005). In this regard, the authors proffer that the management strategies for end-user (EU) systems development in the 21st century should suggest a different and proactive role for users. This paper summarises key traditional definitions from the literature and evaluates their consonance with the technology and business system environment. The impetus for researchers to rethink the traditional definition of EUC is provided through a real world management project involving the development of a university staff workload database that investigated the role of end-users in system enhancement and development.},

To investigate alternative paths into computational work that sidestep the pressures of stereotypes, we interviewed 22 people working on computational projects in transformative fandom, a community centered on media remix and critique. Our participants\textendash primarily women, people of color, and/or LGBTQ+ people\textendash described a set of stereotypes about computing that prevented them from seeing their own highly technical work as computational. However, participants also described projects that not only taught them computing skills but also opened up alternative pathways for involvement in computer science. We draw on these findings to provide recommendations for how educators and professionals might break down stereotypes and incorrect expectations to increase underrepresented groups' involvement and confidence in computer science.},

The author maintains that the discourse of critical pedagogy is based on rationalist assumptions that give rise to repressive myths. Ellsworth argues that if these assumptions, goals, implicit power dynamics,and issues of who produces valid knowledge remain untheorized and untouched, critical pedagogues will continue to perpetuate relations of domination in their classrooms.             The author paints a complex portrait of the practice of teaching for liberation. She reflects on her own role as a White middle-class woman and professor engaged with a diverse group of students developing an antiracist course. Grounded in a clearly articulated political agenda and her experience as a feminist teacher, Ellsworth provides a critique of "empowerment,""student voice," "dialogue," and "critical reflection" and raises provocative issues about the nature of action for social change and knowledge.},

The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and ve principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.},

We suggest that AR is uniquely positioned to support learning through its ability to support students in developing Bconceptual blends\^\textemdash which we propose extend beyond cognitive spaces to include the layering of multiple ideas and physical materials, often supplied by different conversation participants. We document one case study and trace how the narrative structure of a board game, the physical floor materials (e.g. linoleum), a student's first-person embodied experiences, the third-person live camera feed, and the augmented-reality symbols become integrated in the activity. As a result, students' conceptualization of force and friction become fused with a diverse set of intellectual resources. We conclude by suggesting that the framework of liminal blends may inform the design of future AR learning environments and in particular help generate predictions about the ways in which the juxtaposition of certain resources may otherwise produce unexpected results.},

Leveraging testimonial authority, we share our past 8 years of experience designing, implementing, and studying Digital Youth Divas, a programmatic and systemic approach to encouraging middle school Black and Latina girls to participate in STEM. Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level.},

An implication of this research lies in informing evidence-based diagnosis and treatment. However, obtaining clinically valid diagnostic information from sensitive patient populations is challenging. Consequently, researchers have operationalized characteristic online behaviors as ``proxy diagnostic signals'' for building these models. This paper posits a challenge in using these diagnostic signals, purported to support clinical decision-making. Focusing on three commonly used proxy diagnostic signals derived from social media, we find that predictive models built on these data, although offer strong internal validity, suffer from poor external validity when tested on mental health patients. A deeper dive reveals issues of population and sampling bias, as well as of uncertainty in construct validity inherent in these proxies. We discuss the methodological and clinical implications of these gaps and provide remedial guidelines for future research.},

This study examined students' demographic profiles, past high school achieveme:nts, prior computer training and experience, selected behavioral habits, cognitive styles, and problem-solving abilities as possible explanatory variables. One notable result was the emergence of cognitive style as a statistically significant explanatory factor. The fact that none of the models hypothesized in this study accounted for more than 23 percent of the variation in computer proficiency is also notable. On the one hand, these results are consistent with earlier findings. On the other hand, these results also lead to the conclusion that the task of finding effective predictors of computer proficiency remains unfinished.},

Prior work has often achieved this by connecting CS concepts to cultural ideas and practices. Increasingly, however, youth may be encountering sociotechnical and sociopolitical counternarratives about computing, power, and justice, ofering new opportunities to connect CS to students' lives. To understand what role these emerging counternarratives have in secondary CS classrooms, we taught a co-constructed high school course to a racially, ethnically, socioeconomically, and gender diverse classroom, framing the course as both a creative and critical introduction to CS, giving agency to students to incorporate critical themes into their learning. We gathered notes, artifacts, and student responses over the course of 6-weeks, and analyzed the extent to which students brought critical themes into their creative work, developing critical consciousness of CS concepts. We found that before there was space for critical conversations about computing, we had to navigate students' issues of trust, positionality, and the broader inequitable systems of education in which the class occurred. Only after navigating those tensions did students feel safe to have those critical conversations. Once they did, they rapidly embraced the counternarratives, structured their learning around them, and used them to build community and support each other.},

Outcomes-based education, characterised by standardised, objective measurement of performance under controlled conditions, might be appropriate for routinised practice, but cannot account for emergent forms of professional knowledge. Somewhere between developing pre-specified, discipline-based skills and knowledge, and adapting to situated, contextualised conditions, there must be a capacity for dynamically developing unpredictable practices. This, we argue, should be an important focus of professional education across academic and practice settings. We interviewed 14 teachers and professionals studying part-time, across a range of disciplines, including medicine, architecture, law and allied health professions, about the alignment of learning within the workplace and university assessment. Using a sociomaterial lens, we offer a seamful account of educational and professional settings, manifested through assessment, regulatory bodies, technology and materials. Each seam represents ways of patching contexts together (e.g. accreditation stitches requirements of professional practice into educational approaches). Exposing such seams can reveal limitations and possibilities of classrooms and workplaces as sites of professional learning, whereas hiding the complexity of professional practice may be counterproductive to developing students' adaptive capacity to successfully negotiate practice settings.},

I argue that problematic conceptions and desires can be identified across these discourses that lead to orientations of control and discipline, animated by moral essentialism, in the teaching\textendash learning relation. In an effort to conceptualise more open, generative and compassionate orientations, two interconnected forms of pedagogical relations are explored: ethical and ecological. Ethical relations are examined as ongoing coping: appropriate responsiveness in the immediate, reminiscent of Levinas' ``caring encounter.'' Ecological relations have to do with attunement to biological as well as social, political and cultural interconnectivity: the ongoing co-specification of elements improvised in complex systems. The concluding implications for educators encourage a movement to less grand and totalising, more local and contingent orientations \textendash{} ``poorer'' pedagogies. The paper is theory driven, drawing from complexity theory and pedagogical writers aligned with local, ecological conceptions of teaching and learning.},

The motivation for such integration is not only to support in-situ learning, but also to emphasize to students that ethical consideration is inherently part of the technical practice of computing. We propose that the logical place to begin emphasizing ethics is on day one of computing education: in introductory programming classes. This paper presents one approach to ethics integration into such classes: assignments that teach basic programming concepts (e.g., conditionals or iteration) but are contextualized with real-world ethical dilemmas or concepts. We report on experiences with this approach in multiple introductory programming courses, including details about select assignments, insights from instructors and teaching assistants, and results from surveys of a subset of students who took these courses. Based on these experiences we provide preliminary plans for future work, along with a roadmap for instructors to emulate our approach and suggestions for overcoming challenges they might face.},

We argue that unfocused candidates may be penalized for another reason; they threaten established social boundaries. This happens in contexts where evaluators act as gatekeepers for social entities, such as professions. We test how the penalty applied to unfocused candidates varies in an academic accreditation process, a setting where evaluators decide on admitting candidates to an academic discipline and where candidates' prior performance is observable. We find using data on the 2012 national scientific qualification in Italian academia that the valuation penalty applied to unfocused (multidisciplinary) candidates was most pronounced for the most high-performing candidates. High-performing yet ill-fitting candidates threaten the distinctiveness and knowledge domain of the discipline and are hence penalized by evaluators. High-performing multidisciplinary candidates suffered the greatest penalty in small and distinctive academic disciplines and when accreditors were highly typical members of their discipline. Our theory and findings suggest that the categorical imperative may be driven not only by cognitive or capability considerations as typically argued in the literature but also, by attempts to maintain social boundaries.},

  abstract = {Mistaking versatility for universal skills, some companies tend to categorize all software engineers the same not knowing a difference exists. For example, a company may select one of many software engineers to complete a task, later finding that the engineer's skills and style do not match those needed to successfully complete that task. This can result in delayed task completion and demonstrates that a one-size fits all concept should not apply to how software engineers work. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of different software engineers and their working styles we interviewed 21 participants and surveyed 868 software engineers at a large software company and asked them about their work in terms of knowledge worker actions. We identify how tasks, collaboration styles, and perspectives of autonomy can significantly effect different approaches to software engineering work. To characterize differences, we describe empirically informed personas on how they work. Our defined software engineering personas include those with focused debugging abilities, engineers with an active interest in learning, experienced advisors who serve as experts in their role, and more. Our study and results serve as a resource for building products, services, and tools around these software engineering personas.},

  abstract = {The 21st century city is faced with a myriad of social, political and environmental complexities. The increasing global urbanisation puts pressure on the various spheres of government as well as on citizens to continuously redefine and manage public assets and spaces \textendash{} often built for social contexts that no longer exist. While top-down approaches have arguably failed to engage and motivate communities in meaningful ways, bottom-up initiatives have also proved difficult in promoting lasting impact on official policies. The democratisation of digital technologies provides new opportunities for citizens to organise themselves around local issues. These complexities galvanise communities around a civic debate about the present and future identity of the places they live in. Yet, it is still fairly challenging to balance community expectations, on one hand, with transparency regarding the complex decision-making processes inherent to public administration, on the other. In this paper, we present common approaches to placemaking. We then discuss new forms of digital placemaking and illustrate their application through four interventions we ran to investigate digital technology adoption for community engagement initiatives. Based on those scenarios, we investigate: (1) the shifting role of digital technologies as tools employed by individual groups to create placemaking initiatives, and (2) media interventions that inform and bring decision makers at the top, and citizens at the bottom together into more collaborative and focused city making efforts.},

  abstract = {Technologies play an important role in the hiring process for software professionals. Within this process, several studies revealed misconceptions and bad practices which lead to suboptimal recruitment experiences. In the same context, grey literature anecdotally coined the term R\'esum\'e-Driven Development (RDD), a phenomenon describing the overemphasis of trending technologies in both job offerings and resumes as an interaction between employers and applicants. While RDD has been sporadically mentioned in books and online discussions, there are so far no scientific studies on the topic, despite its potential negative consequences. We therefore empirically investigated this phenomenon by surveying 591 software professionals in both hiring (130) and technical (558) roles and identified RDD facets in substantial parts of our sample: 60\% of our hiring professionals agreed that trends influence their job offerings, while 82\% of our software professionals believed that using trending technologies in their daily work makes them more attractive for prospective employers. Grounded in the survey results, we conceptualize a theory to frame and explain R\'esum\'e-Driven Development. Finally, we discuss influencing factors and consequences and propose a definition of the term. Our contribution provides a foundation for future research and raises awareness for a potentially systemic trend that may broadly affect the software industry.},

Arguing that the prevalence of deficit perspective in the setting promotes dependency and robs the survivors' agency, we sought to bring change by exploring possibilities based on the survivors' existing assets. Three configurations illuminate how our design decisions and collective exploration operate to empower participation while attending to the substantial power implicitly and explicitly manifest in existing structures.

A rapid solution strategy is implemented by a tiered arrangement of pure elementary calculus functions in conjunction with Excel NLP solver. With the aid of the calculus functions, a cost index and constraints are represented by equivalent formulas that fully encapsulate an underlining parametrized dynamical system. Excel NLP solver is then employed to minimize (or maximize) the cost index formula, by varying decision parameters, subject to the constraints formulas. The paradigm is demonstrated for several fixed and free-time nonlinear optimal control problems involving integral and implicit dynamic constraints with direct comparison to published results obtained by fundamentally different methods. Practically, applying the paradigm involves no more than defining a few formulas using basic Excel spreadsheet skills.},

  abstract = {Many NLP applications require manual data annotations for a variety of tasks, notably to train classifiers or evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. Depending on the size and degree of complexity, the tasks may be conducted by crowd-workers on platforms such as MTurk as well as trained annotators, such as research assistants. Using a sample of 2,382 tweets, we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Specifically, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers for four out of five tasks, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than \$0.003\textemdash about twenty times cheaper than MTurk. These results show the potential of large language models to drastically increase the efficiency of text classification.},

  abstract = {How can a proponent of change mobilize groups and organizations in support of a common project? Building on an extensive review of social movement theorizing and action, we argue that shared interests, network connections, the availability of resources, and the emergence of political, market and corporate opportunities (the standard topics discussed in extant literature) may be necessary, but are often insufficient for spurring mobilization. Conversely, cultural factors such as frames, identities, or practices are essential. Their presence can facilitate coordinated action even among unlikely allies, and their absence can prevent such action. Inspired by the work of Saul Alinsky (1909\textendash 1972), along with contemporary illustrations, we construct a two-step model of the role of culture in mobilizing for change. We bring attention to a change proponent's cultural competence \textendash{} skill in appreciating the different cultural meanings and values of those involved in a particular project of change \textendash{} and cultural brokerage \textendash{} skill in bridging and negotiating among actors with different cultural repertoires, to reach a temporary truce or covenant. We focus on two types of activities that define cultural brokerage, integration and redefinition, and apply them to the cultural factors of frames, identities, and/or practices. Our paper contributes to contemporary research on social movements, institutional theory, and cultural sociology.},

We argue that, from an organizational point of view, the challenge is to devise new ways to configure (and consider) people as the authors of their work. This means assuming responsibility for, and constructively contributing to, the goals of the organizations to which they belong. Combining insights from theoretical reflection and experience from the field, the article discusses the tools, process and material conditions for fostering practical reflexivity and organizational authorship. We conclude that much is to be gained if we distinguish between authorship and authoring. Authorship is the general process whereby managers and organizational members contribute to the reproduction of organizational realities. Authoring is constituted by the special circumstances whereby authorship is brought to critical consciousness and becomes open to deliberate reorientation.},

A growing body of research exists that attempts to identify this skill gap. However, only few so far explicitly compare opinions of the industry with what is currently being taught in academia. By aggregating data from three previous works, we identify the three biggest non-technical skill gaps between industry and academia for the field of software engineering:               devoting oneself to continuous learning               ,               being creative by approaching a problem from different angles               , and               thinking in a solution-oriented way by favoring outcome over ego               . Eight follow-up interviews were conducted to further explore how the industry perceives these skill gaps, yielding 26 sub-themes grouped into six bigger themes:               stimulating continuous learning               ,               stimulating creativity               ,               creative techniques               ,               addressing the gap in education               ,               skill requirements in industry               , and the               industry selection process               . With this work, we hope to inspire educators to give the necessary attention to the uncovered skills, further mitigating the gap between the industry and the academic world.},

In the case study 42 managers, 15 women and 27 men in the company were interviewed. The findings demonstrate that the male managers were provided with significantly richer opportunities to participate in activities conducive to learning and career development than were female managers. The opportunities and barriers in terms of horizontal and vertical manager mobility, senior managers\quotedblbase{} support, strategic networks, career system, freedom of action and gender stereotypes operated simultaneously as opportunities and barriers to learning and career development for the female and male managers, respectively. The conclusion is that the expansive-restrictive continuum developed by Fuller and Unwin (2004) does not cover the extent to which gender operates as a condition for learning and career development, nor the extent to which the gender order influences the learning environment. Therefore we suggest that the expansiverestrictive model of learning environments would benefit from incorporating or, at least considering, gender dimensions in order to form a gender-sensitive model to analyse learning environments in workplaces.},

Workers with vocational education and training need flexible abilities to solve problems in technology-rich work settings. This study builds on Finnish PIAAC data to understand adults' (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4503) skills for solving problems in technology-rich environments. The results indicate the critical issue that more than two thirds of adults with vocational education and training have weak skills or lack the skills in solving problems in technology-rich environments and that more than one fifth of these adults are at risk. Furthermore, this study indicates that the likelihood of having fragile problem-solving skills is six times higher for adults with vocational education and training than for adults with at least upper secondary qualification. Since the need for problem-solving in technology-rich environments is likely to increase in the future, this study also identifies the indicators for problem-solving skills differences. The models predicting problem-solving skills on the basis of theoretical assumptions as well as empirical support are presented. Our results indicate that adults' lower performance does not seem to be associated with the vocational education and training educational system itself, but is mostly due to age, education in years, occupation, and gender, as well as work-related and everyday life factors. In practice, the models help to develop new approaches to enable novel problem-solving skills in technology-rich environments based on the current European workplace needs.},

However, a better understanding of the mechanisms through which ABCD operates, and the environmental and relational conditions within which it is likely to be most effective, could increase its effectiveness at improving health and well-being and reducing inequalities. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 25 people working in third sector and voluntary organizations to begin to improve understanding about ABCD approaches, how they are implemented, and how they are meeting the needs of disadvantaged populations. These individuals had local area knowledge of programs that follow an ABCD approach and which are currently running in the North West of England. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Four overarching themes gave insight into the principles and practices of ABCD: Relationships and trust as mechanisms for change, Reciprocity and connectivity: ``people not services,'' Accountability and reducing dependency, and A socially sustainable model. ABCD focuses on identifying and developing individual capabilities, relationships, engagement within communities, and outcomes that are meaningful to people and consistent with relationships and support that are reciprocal and acceptable. ABCD is likely to be most effective in supporting vulnerable people where building trust is mirrored by an institutional and relational environment that is trustworthy and facilitative of developing people's capabilities.},

  abstract = {Scholars have called repeatedly for more nuanced understandings of power and organizational knowledge, but researchers have yet to integrate available critical frameworks that could link these concepts. Moreover, existing analyses of power in organizational knowledge tend to focus on role differences but do not yet consider how social differences \textendash{} including gender, race and sexuality \textendash{} shape knowledge. Working from a practice-based approach, I draw upon standpoint theory and intersectionality to show how whiteness, masculinity and heteronormativity are embedded in organizational knowledge. I construct this argument using a case study at a US university known for having some of the best systems for building organizational knowledge about sexual violence on campus. I argue that the university's practices \textendash{} specifically those related to interpretation and definition \textendash{} mask heterogeneity in knowledge across the university. I also show how practices give the university's knowledge the appearance of neutrality and, subsequently, can unintentionally defer important organizational actions.},

It also brings new challenges to our established methods of working and emphasizes the need for new expertise and new world views. The paper have shown that ICT4D 2.0 focuses on reframing the poor. Where ICT4D 1.0 marginalized them, allowing a supply-driven focus, ICT4D 2.0 centralizes them, creating a demand-driven focus. Where ICT4D 1.0 - fortified by the "bottom of the pyramid" concept - characterized the poor largely as passive consumers, ICT4D 2.0 sees them as active producers and innovators.},

  author = {Herley, Cormac},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual threats, and fully 100\% of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},

Providing scaffolding allows learners to deal with a problem's complexity and successfully solve and learn from these kinds of problems. In this paper, we describe a theory of learning-bydoing and suggest several ways that the "doing" can be supported without forgetting the learning. We use the metaphors of black-box and glass-box scaffolding to suggest how scaffolding might be used to support learning and performance. Black-box scaffolding is scaffolding that facilitates student performance. Black-box scaffolding performs a task in place of the student performing that performance goal, usually because learning to perform that goal is determined to be unimportant for the learning goals of the activity. Glass-box scaffolding is scaffolding that facilitates performance and learning. It is important for the student to understand what glass-box scaffolding is providing because we want the student to be able to take on the functions that the glass-box scaffolding is providing. Finally, we illustrate how glass-box and black-box scaffolding have been used in two educational software programs.},

Together, these elements combined to provide (1) awareness and willingness to use digital tools, (2) regular opportunities to build internet self-efficacy, and (3) ways to collectively overcome digital obstacles.

We take advantage of an exogenous state and county level policy shock ``Ban-the-Box'' in the United States to further disentangle the underlying mechanism of how labor market discrimination affects formerly incarcerated individuals in their entrepreneurial choices. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship is a viable alternative career choice for formerly incarcerated people, yielding both higher income and lower recidivism rates. In addition to reporting robustness checks and addressing alternative explanations, we discuss theoretical, empirical, and policy implications.},

However, the well-known limitations inherent in this learning framework cannot be talked out of existence, and there is an urgent need for insight and tools capable of distinguishing between the genuine possibilities in the area and how to establish fruitful interaction between workplace learning and educational learning. It is, first and foremost, a matter of viewing learning from the perspective of the learner, because adults are not very inclined to learn something of which they cannot see the point on the basis of their own life situation. As a grounding for this, a contemporary and comprehensive learning theory is needed. The outline of such a theory and an example of how it can be used are presented.},

Varying forms of ``projects,'' co-located and distributed, have populated computing curricula for decades and are generally deemed an answer to this call. We performed a qualitative study to describe how project course students are able to capitalize on the promise of enabling learning environments. This critical perspective was motivated by the circumstance of the present-day education systems being heavily regulated for the precipitated production of human capital. The students involved in our study described education system-imposed and group-imposed narratives of narrowed opportunities, as well as many self-related challenges. However, students welcomed autonomy as an enjoyable condition and linked it with motivation. Whole-group commitment and self-related attributes such as taking care of one's own learning appeared as important conditions.

Starting from a critique of current policies and practices of lifelong learning that are based in instrumentalism and individualism, the article addresses the diversities of working-class women's multiple identities and considers some of the (apparent) wider benefits of learning for working-class women. The article concludes that many working-class women are trapped in a cycle of lifelong earning that centres on low-paid, low-status jobs. What they learn is that, in a learning society that remains driven by market forces based in inequalities of gender, race and class, there is no political escape.},

The change perspective proposes the emergence of ``Legitimate Alternative Structural Configurations'' (LASC) from which organizational actors find guidance for enacting behaviors that promote greater inclusion of the marginalized in a global organization. Six propositions are offered for considering the ways in which marginal actors facilitate the emergence of LASC. This conceptualization of change provides a useful lens for recognizing, understanding, and promoting the transformation of oppressive organizational structures (in this case, the Roman Catholic Church), while emphasizing the role of marginal actors in the process of change.},

The need for the proposed framework stems from two concerns. First, formal training and informal learning represent incompatible levels of discourse, making it difficult to have a cohesive understanding of workplace learning. Second, workplace learning appear to exclude a large segment of HRD practice, particularly when formal training programs occur in the work setting.},

Drawing from discourses of data literacy; epistemic agency and lived experience; and critical race theory, we analyze the workshops' activities and outcomes. Through this analysis, three themes emerge: the tensions between epistemic agency and the context of work, encountering the ordinariness of racism through data work, and understanding the personal as communal and intersectional. Finally, critical race theory also prompts us to consider the very notions of data literacy that undergird our workshop activities. From this analysis, we ofer a series of suggestions for approaching designing data literacy activities, taking into account critical race theory.},

This article contributes to stigma identity management and workplace diversity research by focusing on the antecedents and outcomes of SDRs' responses in organizations. We apply a novel event systems perspective to disclosure events, which allows us to develop a generalizable framework to understand the psychological and behavioral responses of SDRs across different types of stigmas. Our framework offers a unique perspective on how disclosure events trigger stigma-induced identity threat, which underlies a range of SDRs' hostile and supportive behaviors. Overall, we propose that these responses of SDRs have important implications for the perpetuation and dismantling of stigma in the workplace. We offer implications for research and practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The field of engineering education research has seen substantial growth in the last five years but it often lacks theoretical and empirical work on engineering learning that could be supplied by the learning sciences. In addition, the learning sciences have focused very little on engineering learning to date. PURPOSE This article summarizes prior work in the learning sciences and discusses one perspective\textemdash situative learning\textemdash in depth. Situativity refers to the central role of context, including the physical and social aspects of the environment, on learning. Furthermore, it emphasizes the socially and culturally negotiated nature of thought and action of persons in interaction. The aim of the article is to provide a foundation for future work on engineering learning and to suggest ways in which the learning sciences and engineering education research communities might work to their mutual benefit. SCOPE/METHOD The article begins with a brief discussion of recent developments in engineering education research. After an initial overview of the field of learning sciences, situative learning is discussed and three analytical aspects of the perspective are outlined: social and material context, activities and interactions, and participation and identity. Relevant expert commentaries are interspersed throughout the article. The article concludes with an exploration of the potential for contributions from the learning sciences to understanding engineering learning. CONCLUSION There are many areas of mutual benefit for engineering education and the learning sciences and many potential areas of collaborative research that can contribute not only to engineering learning but to the learning sciences.},

  abstract = {Computer science (CS) education finds itself at a pivotal moment to reckon with what it means to accept, use, and create technologies, with the continued recruitment of minoritized students into the field. In this paper, we build on the oral traditions of educating with stories, and take the reader on two journeys. We begin with a story that leads us in thinking about where computer science education is, in the wake of slavery, under the New Jim Code. Within a BlackCrit framework, we shake the grounds of the computer science field, where technologies are often promoted as objective, but reflect and reproduce existing inequalities. In tune with maintaining current systems of power, efforts to broaden participation in computer science have been heavily driven by industry, government, and military interests. These interests ultimately push us farther away from sustainable relations with the earth and with each other, and risk the very lives of the same communities the field claims to help. However, we can rewrite the narratives of the role of technology in our lives. We present a second story in which we place abolitionist theories and practices in conversation with computer science education. In this paper we explore (1) In what ways does computing education support systems that enable Black death? and (2) How might integrating an abolitionist framework into computer science open up possibilities for worldbuilding and dreaming in the name of Black Life? We imagine a different future where computer science is used as a tool in life-affirming, world-building projects. We invite readers to engage with this piece as a part of an active dialogue towards combating anti-Black logics in the field of computer science education.},

Their onboarding experience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and other short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of the onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as fixing bugs or implementing small features. Nevertheless, we do not have a systematic view of how tasks influence onboarding. In this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15 engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their team \textendash{} to understand and characterize developers' onboarding experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed by them while onboarding. We present how tasks interact with new developers through three representative themes: learning, confidence building, and socialization. We also discuss three onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros and cons and offer situational recommendations. Furthermore, we triangulate our interview findings with a developer survey (N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37) and find that survey results suggest that our findings are representative and our recommendations are actionable. Practitioners could use our findings to improve their onboarding processes, while researchers could find new research directions from this study to advance the understanding of developer onboarding.

Electronic textiles include sewable microcontrollers that can be connected to sensors and actuators by stitching circuits with conductive thread. We present findings from a junior high Native Arts class and an academically-oriented summer camp in which Native American youth ages 12-15 years created individual and collective e-textile designs using the LilyPad Arduino. In our discussion we address how a culturally responsive open design approach to ethnocomputing with e-textile activities can provide a productive but also challenging context for design agency and cultural connections for American Indian youth, and how these findings can inform the design of a broader range of introductory computational activities for all.},

While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K\textendash 12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K\textendash 12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.},

The IS designs have to he extremely reliable, artd yet easy to modi@. A number of formai design techniques have been suggested in the past. Some of these techniques are studied. CASE, 4GL's and reuse are being applied to increase the productivity of the developer. These tectilques should be exploited to develop 1Ss. A survey of the various Y `fCASE tools available is presented. The impact of CA E and 4GL's on software development, and the reuse paradigm are put forth. The above mentioned techniques (CASE, 4GL's and Reuse) have been used widely and rather than reinventing the wheel each time, a methodology that optimizes these techniques and uses them collectively towards efficient IS development is presented.},

  abstract = {Technical interviews have predominantly been used by companies to recruit students for software-related and other computing jobs. Since the content of the interviews has an overlap with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), we introduced a mock interview activity to promote students' awareness of the technical interview process and build students' confidence in problem-solving in a DSA course. In this short paper, we (1) describe the logistics for embedding such an intervention, and (2) explain the affordances and opportunities for improvement of the activity through student perspectives. Students were explained the technical interview process and asked to interview each other twice during the semester on coding problems. Students received the intervention positively describing that the activity helped them to understand the technical interview process, prepared them for future interviews, built their confidence to secure a job, and supported them in knowing their strengths and weaknesses. Opportunities for improving the activity include providing interview questions explicitly, offering an alternate activity for students who are not interested in computing careers, and reducing the length requirement for interviews. Given students' positive reception of the intervention, we recommend that instructors adopt these mock interview exercises in computing courses to improve students' access to professional development opportunities.},

Through the lens of intersectionality, we examine how community health workers of diverse backgrounds and contracted status respond to the mandated use of digital payment methods and long payment delays. We highlight how resilience in this context is situated in workers' intersecting socioeconomic and professional identities, which shape the assets and constraints that workers engage with in efforts to be resilient. We leverage our findings to discuss how assets-based approaches to design can be further operationalized and used to sustainably support resilience.},

Gatekeepers also appear to facilitate external communication by their locally-oriented project colleagues. A follow-up study five years later showed that almost all gatekeeping project leaders had been promoted up the managerial ladder; in contrast, one half of the non-gatekeeping project leaders had ascended the technical ladder. This implies that higher managerial levels demand strong interpersonal as well as technical skills.},

Because of this, many students, parents, teachers, administrators and even researchers feel that it is intuitively correct to say that since different people prefer to learn visually, auditively, kinesthetically or whatever other way one can think of, we should also tailor teaching, learning situations and learning materials to those preferences. Is this a problem? The answer is a resounding: Yes! Broadly speaking, there are a number of major problems with the notion of learning styles. First, there is quite a difference between the way that someone prefers to learn and that which actually leads to effective and efficient learning. Second, a preference for how one studies is not a learning style. Most so-called learning styles are based on types; they classify people into distinct groups. The assumption that people cluster into distinct groups, however, receives very little support from objective studies. Finally, nearly all studies that report evidence for learning styles fail to satisfy just about all of the key criteria for scientific validity. This article delivers an evidence-informed plea to teachers, administrators and researchers to stop propagating the learning styles myth.},

For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them.

In this paper, we follow a participatory action research approach and collaborate with various stakeholders at an entrepreneurial co-working space to design ``Tech Help Desk'', an on-going technical service for entrepreneurs. Our model for technical assistance is strategic, in how it is designed to fit the context of local entrepreneurs, and responsive, in how it prioritizes emergent needs. From our engagements with 19 entrepreneurs and support personnel, we reflect on the challenges with existing technology support for non-technological entrepreneurs. Our work highlights the importance of ensuring technological support services can adapt based on entrepreneurs' ever-evolving priorities, preferences and constraints. Furthermore, we find technological support services should maintain broad technical support for entrepreneurs' long tail of computing challenges.},

Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs.

To address this knowledge gap, we present a case study of how a nine-member team of end-user programmers designed an educational program to bring job-relevant computing skills to adult populations that have traditionally not been reached by existing efforts. This team conceived, implemented, and delivered Cloud Based Data Science (CBDS), a data science course designed for adults in their local community in historically marginalized groups that are underrepresented in computing fields. Notably, nobody on the course development team was a full-time educator or software engineer. To reduce the amount of time and cost required to launch their program, they repurposed end-user programming skills and tools from their professions, such as data-analytic programming and reproducible scientific research workflows. This case study demonstrates how the spirit of end-user programming can be a vehicle to drive social change through grassroots efforts.},

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.},

While universalism in such research is widely rejected, sole focus on the "particular'' is also commonly critiqued. Kentaro Toyama unpacks this tension, calling for balance via "deliberate efforts to understand the interplay of human universals and cultural differences, and how it pertains to design.'' In this paper, one such deliberate effort, we introduce the notion of feminist solidarity---as theorized by Chandra Mohanty---for drawing connections across borders in CSCW and HCI research, design, and practice. To enable contributions in these fields to cross cultures and geographies in productive ways, we draw attention to commonalities in the struggles and processes of resistance operating in different contexts of study. To do this, we present lessons learned from conducting three comparative studies in six contexts, which were located across various borders. The primary contribution of our analysis is to leverage a feminist solidarity-based approach towards extending conversations on comparative, transnational, and feminist CSCW and HCI research, design, and practice. Our focus remains on resource-constrained regions across the world, in both the Global North and South.},

While the use of Big Five personality measures is increasingly common across social sciences, their validity outside of western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations is unclear. Adopting a comprehensive psychometric approach to analyze 29 face-to-face surveys from 94,751 respondents in 23 low- and middle-income countries, we show that commonly used personality questions generally fail to measure the intended personality traits and show low validity. These findings contrast with the much higher validity of these measures attained in internet surveys of 198,356 self-selected respondents from the same countries. We discuss how systematic response patterns, enumerator interactions, and low education levels can collectively distort personality measures when assessed in large-scale surveys. Our results highlight the risk of misinterpreting Big Five survey data and provide a warning against na\"ive interpretations of personality traits without evidence of their validity.},

Our fndings highlight the need to be mindful when choosing terms to describe ADM systems, because terminology can have unintended consequences, and may impact the robustness and replicability of HCI research. Additionally, our fndings indicate that terminology can be used strategically (e.g., in communication about ADM systems) to infuence people's perceptions and evaluations of these systems.},

  abstract = {Although the concept of wisdom is ancient, empirical research on it has only recently received attention in gerontology. This coincides with a critical turn away from a deficit model of aging, viewing aging as a series of losses, toward a more supportive and developmental model. This paper draws on this recent work to consider how wisdom can be a critical lens for HRI researchers and other technology design researchers to pay more attention to the coping strategies that older adults accumulated throughout their lives. We engaged in a six-month collaborative design process with community-dwelling older adults. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we found that wisdom as a design concept helps researchers to critically examine how they define knowledge. Wisdom as an accumulation of experiential knowledge of older adults helps researchers rethink the definition of knowledge\textemdash valuing computational and technological knowledge\textemdash in the field of HRI. Second, wisdom leads researchers to the past experiences of older adults. Although past experiences are as important as current experiences, they are not actively considered in robot design studies for older adults. We hope wisdom as a critical lens could allow researchers to integrate the invisible aspects of older adults' aging experiences into the existing practices of designing robots for aging users.},

Digitization of work practices has made a noticeable impact on how engineers gain expertise and solve problems they encounter at work. In this paper we use a workplace learning ecology lens to examine engineers' situated information seeking to identify practices associated with the use of online resources. Building on a previous qualitative interview study, we developed and administered a survey consisting of 16 items to assess use of online resources across learning experiences. We found high use of online resources but with variations among the use of specific resources by field, problem, and learning goal. LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, Reddit, and technology vendor websites were the primary online platforms used by respondents for both learning and problem-solving. Respondents placed different levels of trust in online resources. Social media, especially Twitter, was trusted least across all sources. The highest trust was placed on websites of technology vendors. Findings from this work can help create better educational content as well as pedagogical interventions that use online resources for training the future workforce.},

Interpretive flexibility, the structure of informatic and work process needs and arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between illstructured and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this flexibility with the process of tacking back-and-forth between the ill-structured and well-structured aspects of the arrangements. Boundary objects are not useful at just any level of scale or without full consideration of the entire model. The article discusses these aspects of the architecture of boundary objects and includes a discussion of one of the ways that boundary objects appeared as a concept in earlier work done by Star. It concludes with methodological considerations about how to study the system of boundary objects and infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Changing technologies and competition in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) are challenging the learning of individual workers and teams alongside and through work. Organisations call for employees' autonomy and self-directedness executed by agile operations and low hierarchies, where learning is also increasingly the responsibility of the individuals and teams themselves and occurs in practice without strong control of the organisation. Therefore, the multidimensional concept of selfdirected learning becomes essential in the context of learning at work. In this study, we examine how employees in the ICT sector describe self-directed learning practices in the context of workplace learning. Our data consist of interviews with ICT employees in two organisations, which undergo an applied discourse analysis. The workers talked about self-directed learning as an obliged, creativity-enhanced as well as flexible and fast-paced practice. Self-directed learning was also described as a practice tied to work itself. The paper concludes with a discussion on how these partly conflicting discourses about selfdirected learning practice in work could be considered in practices related to enhancing such learning in the ICT field. Suggestions for future investigations are also presented.},

While e{$\carriagereturn$}orts exist to change these stereotypes, we argue that it may be possible to challenge a student's belief that stereotypes of computer scientists are relevant to whether they can become a computer scientist. In our previous work, we presented a model of five factors that influence students' decisions to major in computer science (CS). Data were collected from interviews with 31 students enrolled in introductory CS courses at two public universities in the United States. Here we elaborate on our grounded theory of one of these factors: how students assess their fit with CS. We describe how students measure their fit with CS in terms of the amount they see themselves as expressing the traits of singular focus, asocialness, competition, and maleness and how students make interpretations and decisions based upon these measurements. We found that students' interpretations were influenced by their attitudes toward the nature of stereotypes.},

In total, 24 HCI researchers, located primarily in the United States, participated in an interview, survey, or both. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four tensions\textemdash exploitation, membership, disclosure, and allyship. We explore the complexity involved in each, demonstrating that an equitable endpoint may not be possible, but this work is still worth pursuing when researchers make certain considerations. We emphasize that researchers who work with marginalized people should account for each tension in their research approaches to move forward. Finally, we propose an allyship-oriented approach to research that draws inspiration from discourse occurring in tangential fields and activist spaces and pushes the field into a new paradigm of research with marginalized people.},

Aligning with feminist, critical race and critical computing commitments, this paper ofers a genealogical approach to show how injustice and violence endure, despite and because of a narrative of progress and positive change.},

We then conducted 77 email interviews to interpret our findings and to understand the influence of contextual factors on the ratings. After synthesizing the findings, we believe that the top five distinguishing characteristics of great engineers are writing good code, adjusting behaviors to account for future value and costs, practicing informed decision-making, avoiding making others' jobs harder, and learning continuously. We relate the findings to prior work, and discuss implications for researchers, practitioners, and educators.},

Using a family of concepts inherent in organisational and the ICT occupational cultures as a framework of analysis this paper presents the results from interviews with 90 professional women in the New Zealand ICT workforce regarding their mentoring experiences. Only the large Government and international organisations provided formal mentoring programs, in which 12 of the women had participated. Forty of the women had developed mentoring relationships serendipitously, usually with senior male colleagues. These relationships definitely contributed to their career advancement. A number of women wanted mentors but were unable to find them. If the industry is concerned about the lack of women in ICT then it is recommended that where formal programs are not available access to external mentoring programs should be a part of the human resources policies for ICT workers.},

  abstract = {What is end-user development (EUD) and when does a user become an end-user developer? Since the concept of EUD encompasses methods as well as practices of appropriating technology, it is not easy to answer these questions and several researchers already dealt with these issues. Within our chapter we suggest to conceptually extend our understanding of both EUD and the end user (developer). We draw on experiences we gained from past research exploring EUD in practice. We reflect upon the concepts of ``gentle slope of complexity'', ``tailoring languages'' and ``appropriation'' which we situate within the broader concept of ``infrastructuring''. We claim that EUD is given whenever an end user starts modifying the permanent aspects of an application (soft- or hardware) and, thus, starts climbing the tailorability mountain \textendash{} or in our words, the tailorability staircase \textendash{} and switching to a higher level to perform a specific practice. In our newly developed terminology this very moment, called ``point of infrastructure'', is characterized by a break-down in the current practices which leads an end user to becoming an end-user developer.},

  abstract = {Increasingly companies assess a computing candidate's capabilities using technical interviews (TIs). Yet students struggle to code on demand, and there is already an insufficient amount of computing graduates to meet industry needs. Therefore, it is important to understand students' perceptions of TIs, and other professional experiences (e.g., computing jobs). We surveyed 740 undergraduate computing students at three universities to examine their experiences with the hiring process, as well as the impact of professional and cultural experiences (e.g., familial support) on computing identity. We considered the interactions between these experiences and social identity for groups underrepresented in computing \textemdash women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx students. Among other findings, we observed that students that did not have positive experiences with TIs had a reduced computing identity, but that facing discrimination during technical interviews had the opposite effect. Social support may play a role. Having friends in computing bolsters computing identity for Hispanic/Latinx students, as does a supportive home environment for women. Also, freelance computing jobs increase computing identity for Black/African American students. Our findings are intended to raise awareness of the best way for educators to help diverse groups of students to succeed, and to inform them of the experiences that may influence students' engagement, resilience, and computing identity development.},

  abstract = {Media and literature frequently describe the need to increase the number of workers in computing to meet growing demands and highlight the necessity of broadening participation. Although companies may claim they want to do better, and some have begun to develop and implement initiatives to promote and improve diversity, ongoing reports of discrimination and metrics demonstrate there is still a long way to go to achieve inclusivity and parity in representation, particularly for women, Hispanic/Latinx, and Black/African American workers. To learn more about students' pathways to a career, especially those which are underrepresented in the discipline, and to examine what they believe may ameliorate interview preparation and the hiring process, we employed phenomenography. Phenomenography has been used in computing and engineering education as a qualitative methodology to assess how people may experience and conceptualize phenomena. This inquiry applied the theoretical framework of intersectionality to examine the experiences of minoritized undergraduate computing students and their pathways to job attainment, and to learn about what may help to improve the process. Specifically, the investigation was guided by the research question: What do students feel would help to improve hiring in computing? The participants included 16 students in computing, all of whom had completed at least one technical interview and received at least one job offer. The goal in phenomenographic data analysis is to develop an outcome space \textemdash{} the visual representation of a hierarchical set of distinct, but logically related, categories. From the analysis, an outcome space emerged with five main categories of description about the kinds of obstacles students encountered in regard to the hiring process in computing and industry practices: Uncertainty, interview techniques, time demands of preparation, anxiety management, and improving inclusivity. Yet, our goal was not to focus on the issues faced, but the solutions to resolve them. As such, the perceptions of the students' experiences guided the creation of a set of recommendations for students, academia, and industry, to mitigate concerns with the current process and to consider avenues for improvement.},

Our study presents an anti-deficit approach for the imperative of improving diversity in computing, and to bridge the gap between cultural backgrounds, academic curricula, and the needs of industry.

However, little is known about how these groups function as an activity system. With current technology enabling the forming of virtual communities and the meteoric rise in use of the Salesforce CRM (customer relationship management) platform, a group of women have formed a coaching and learning community designed to help women move from Salesforce administrators to software developers through learning to code. We used activity systems analysis (ASA) to investigate this real-world instance of the larger phenomenon using an ethnographic approach. We used ASA to organize and make sense of the data by first creating a table listing the points on the activity system triangle (subject, rules, object, etc.) and filling in the points of the triangle based on the design of the coaching and learning group as described by participants; this gave us a high-level view of the activity system. To understand the subjects' point of view of the system, we then created a new column in the table to fill in themes that emerged from our qualitative data analysis organized by dimension of the activity system. This process enabled us to capture the activity and the voices of participants as well as tensions that had emerged in the system. Findings show a range of outcomes, from participants crediting the group as a kickstart to the journey to successfully landing a job as a developer to members stalling in their progress after involvement. Results also show that purposeful tensions of welcoming novice questions and offering unsolicited verbal encouragement built into the activity system create a welcoming, safe environment for women learning to code.},

One of these women's choices for retraining are the so-called coding boot camps that teach programming skills through intensive multi-week courses. This article reports on a qualitative research study focused on the Silicon Valley area of California. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to investigate the larger context surrounding women entering computing professions through boot camp learning sites, including: the               environment               of a booming technology workforce, boot camps as               learning settings               , the               characteristics               of women who attend boot camps, how retraining at a coding boot camp influence women's computing               self-efficacy               and               outcome expectations               , and the               performance attainments               of women at boot camps. Interview data was collected from 14 women who had attended boot camps\textemdash first before graduating from the boot camp and again after six months in the workforce. To contextualize the computing ecosystem, we conducted single interviews with 6 boot camp organizers/curriculum developers, 7 industry hiring managers, and 14 university computer science faculty. To provide a contrast with women at boot camps, we interviewed 5 women who majored in computer science at the university and with 17 men who had attended boot camps. Structural data coding and analysis was done focused on the SCCT mechanisms of environment, person inputs, learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and performance attainments. Findings here demonstrate that training at a boot camp can be the catalyst for college-educated women to attain computing jobs and careers, although these entry-level jobs may be a compromise to the goal of a software development job and are unlikely to lead to a job at large, well-known, established technology companies.},

Findings show that tinkering falls into two main categories: testing an educated guess (more successful) or haphazard trial and error (less successful). In addition, learners occasionally do not tinker to test a successful solution but rather wait to ask another for confirmation of their educated guess before proceeding. Conclusions from this work show that tinkering leads to success when participants are thinking critically about what the code is doing and have hypothesized expected results from code changes. These findings suggest that designers of end-user programmer instructional materials would assist learners by giving explicit tools and techniques that foster successful tinkering.},

Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1               , 94\textendash 111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray,               International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10               , 98\textendash 129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al.               International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25               (1), 1\textendash 34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.},

  abstract = {Researchers have developed cognitive systems capable of human-level performance at complex tasks, but constructing these systems required substantial time and expertise. To address this challenge, a new line of research has begun to coalesce around the concept of cognitive systems that users can teach rather than program. A key goal of this research is to develop natural approaches for end users to directly train these systems to perform new tasks. However, there does not currently exist a language for describing the key components of cognitive system training interactions and how these components relate to the concept of naturalness for end users. This paper begins to explore this gap. To lay the foundation for this exploration, we review relevant prior machine learning and interaction frameworks as well as the human-computer interaction literature to identify characteristics of systems that have historically been natural for end users to interact with. Based on this review, we propose the Natural Training Interactions (NTI) framework, which decomposes cognitive system training interaction into patterns, types, and modalities, all of which support the acquisition of different kinds of knowledge. Finally, we discuss how this framework characterizes existing research within this space and how it can guide future research.},

  abstract = {Recent initiatives to broaden participation in computing aim to provide increased computer science (CS) access and opportunity for underrepresented K-12 students. Researchers have identified challenges related to teaching CS courses in sways that ensure underrepresented student populations are engaged, interested, and motivated to participate in computing coursework, including making course content relevant to students' lives and interests. An emerging area of scholarship proposes merging culturally relevant pedagogy with CS in order to develop engaging and rigorous computing instruction for diverse groups of students. Much of this work has been theoretical rather than practical; thus, we present case studies of three programs to describe practice-based examples of culturally relevant computer science teaching and learning. Consistent themes across the instructional practices we share include engagement and relevance; confidence and identity; and social justice. These foundational practical applications of culturally relevant CS education can inform efforts to enhance engagement, preparation, participation, and persistence in computing for underrepresented students toward successfully addressing inclusion, diversity, and equity.},

The model theorizes three primary sub-constructs that contribute to the development of a computing identity: belief in one's performance/competence, interest, and recognition in computing. Drawing on data from a nationally representative survey of more than 1,700 college students at 22 colleges and universities, the study tested the alignment of the theorized model to the measures on the survey. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to validate whether the appropriate measures loaded on the three separate sub-constructs. Criterion-related validity was also established by testing whether the computing identity measures predicted the choice of a computer science career. The results reveal that a computing identity proxy based on the theorized measures was a highly significant predictor of students' computer science and information technology career choice (p {$<$} 0.0001). In addition, this work also established criterion-related validity by showing gender differences that had been found by prior work in computing. Finally, the theorized measures were found to be reliable and internally consistent. The educational understanding of computing identities may provide an important tool to help researchers and practitioners improve student persistence in computer science.},

The results showed variance in the Authenticity, Balance and Challenge (ABC) parameters across career stages by gender, with balance increasingly important in full midcareer for women but of lesser importance for men. Authenticity showed a similar pattern for men and women, with authenticity rising for women and declining for men in very late career as predicted by the model. Challenge remained consistent for men and women, declining in importance over time. The study contribution offers sharper resonance of the KCM through closely segmented midlife career stages for an unemployed population undergoing career transitions.},

Many texts use these terms without any clear definition, or employ conflicting definitions and boundaries. The paper therefore proposes an alternative way of analysing learning situations in terms of attributes of formality and informality. Applying this analysis to a range of learning contexts, one of which is described, suggests that there are significant elements of formal learning in informal situations, and elements of informality in formal situations; the two are inextricably inter-related. The nature of this inter-relationship, the ways it is written about and its impact on learners and others, are closely related to the organisational, social, cultural, economic, historical and political contexts in which the learning takes place. The paper briefly indicates some of the implications of our analysis for theorising learning, and for policy and practice.},

We heard differences in orientations to computing in men's and women's interviews when they arrive at the university. We have traced the effects of these differences on women's sense of belonging and comfort in the program, and on their decisions to stay or leave. While most of the male students describe an early and persistent magnetic attraction between themselves and computers, women much more frequently link their computer science interest to a larger societal framework. Nearly half of the women we interviewed attached their interest in computer science to other arenas, such as medicine, education, space exploration, and the arts. For many of these women, while interest in computing is strong, they are concerned that their study of computer science not require a myopic focus on the machine, or detach them from people and other concerns. We discuss how computer science curriculum and culture frequently mirror and bestow prestige on an orientation toward computing commonly identified with men, while devaluing and pushing to the margins the orientations associated with women. The identification of computing as a male domain is so pervasive that men suffer far less from a mismatch with the dominant culture than do women. In this context, we discuss the importance of "revisioning" computer science, so that the answer to the question: "what is computer science?" incorporates and values women's perspectives as well as men's.},

We do so as an interdisciplinary group of academics interested in `undoing' the conventional and individualising norms of reflective practice in academic settings, particularly when it comes to planning and reflecting on group processes for research. In the process of planning a project to investigate mentoring in the professions of social work and teaching, we reflected on our own collaborative academic practices through co-facilitated discussion, the creation of visual `d/artaphacts', written reflections on our perceptions of `unlearning' and academic collaboration, and reviewing how our diverse disciplines have engaged with unlearning in research literature and practice. These responses generated insights into the intricacies of the collaborative practice of unlearning in a professional research environment. We draw on these conversations, d/artaphacts, and reflections to compose five principles for a pedagogy of unlearning that can be applied in mentoring and professional practice settings. The principles highlight the importance of approaching unlearning as a collaborative activity for sustainable professional practice and for supporting the development of professional identities in fluid and complex relational work environments.},

Using a critical psychology lens, we find that the historical focus on higher-income settings and workers with relatively privileged status reflects the neoliberal underpinning implicit in most of VIO psychology. We identify five marginalizing conditions that act at macro levels to perpetuate the status quo and restrict progress toward social justice: group bias, forced movement of people, poverty, unemployment, and lack of decent work. Our review of these conditions accentuates the necessity of social justice praxis at multiple ecological levels to effect significant progress. We propose a set of recommendations for the future that highlight the importance of articulating and deconstructing context, power, and perception implicit in extant VIO endeavors. Our recom\- mendations challenge the field to: (1) extend the scope of the locations and range of ecological levels at which VIO research and practice are carried out, (2) highlight who is and is not served and benefitted by VIO research and practice, and (3) question the underlying values and ideo\- logical assumptions of existing VIO research and practice. We call for greater critical con\- sciousness among VIO psychologists in order to ensure the relevance and benefit of our research and practice for all workers around the globe.},

They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage.Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns. We also discuss domain analysis tools and language development systems that may help to speed up DSL development. Finally, we present a number of open problems.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses Implementation of a new educational approach to develop competencies for the future STEM workforce, and to build knowledge on success factors for educating a non-traditional target population in data competencies. It is widely accepted that a data capable workforce is critical to science and industry. The literature suggests that the need for data science and data analytics competencies in industry and academia is accelerating at a rapid pace. At the same time, census and demographic data predict that the pool of traditional college age students will continue to decrease. To meet the increasing demand for a data capable workforce, it is essential to leverage the nontraditional student pool, reskilling and upskilling the current workforce, simply because the traditional student output is nowhere near sufficient to meet the need. The current work is to implement a new program designed to provide adult learners with bachelor's degrees and post baccalaureate certificates in Data Analytics. This results in upskilling or reskilling the existing workforce to add value to industry and academia. The program is differentiated from traditional programs by catering to non-traditional students through specific pedagogies such as incorporating required mathematics competencies into Data Analytics courses, using specific pedagogies proven to work with the non-traditional population, as well as removing constraints by offering evening courses, easing registration obstacles, etc. The paper suggests a proposed curriculum, discusses the rationale behind each differentiated option, and explains how the program is being implemented.},

Previous research has addressed this issue by proposing standardized checklists to document datasets. This paper expands that field of inquiry by proposing a shift of perspective: from documenting datasets toward documenting data production. We draw on participatory design and collaborate with data workers at two companies located in Bulgaria and Argentina, where the collection and annotation of data for machine learning are outsourced. Our investigation comprises 2.5 years of research, including 33 semi-structured interviews, five co-design workshops, the development of prototypes, and several feedback instances with participants. We identify key challenges and requirements related to the integration of documentation practices in real-world data production scenarios. Our findings comprise important design considerations and highlight the value of designing data documentation based on the needs of data workers. We argue that a view of documentation as a boundary object, i.e., an object that can be used differently across organizations and teams but holds enough immutable content to maintain integrity, can be useful when designing documentation to retrieve heterogeneous, often distributed, contexts of data production.

We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our research community \textbackslash,---\textbackslash,one bias-centered, the other power-aware. We highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation.

In the second one, we highlight the corporate forces and market imperatives involved in the labor of data workers that subsequently shape ML datasets.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. While the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of farreaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us, ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.},

We then identify three emergent framings: (1) inquiry, (2) design and (3) reimagination that build on and expand these critical traditions in todays' K-12 computing education.

Accompanying this research was a resurgence of interest in the use of personality tests in high-stakes selection environments. Yet there are numerous potential problems associated with the current operational use of personality. As such, 5 former journal editors from Personnel Psychology and the Journal of Applied Psychology (2 primary outlets for such research), who have collectively reviewed over 7,000 manuscripts and who have no vested interest in personality testing, reconsider the research on the use of personality tests in environments where important selection decisions are made. Their comments are based on a panel discussion held at the 2004 SIOP conference. Collectively, they come to several conclusions. First, faking on self-report personality tests cannot be avoided and perhaps is not the issue; the issue is the very low validity of personality tests for predicting job performance. Second, as such, using published self-report personality tests in selection contexts should be reconsidered. Third, personality constructs may have value for employee selection, but future research should focus on finding alternatives to self-report personality measures.},

While significant earlier work has investigated the challenges that novice web developers encounter, little research is available about teaching while coping with the field's considerable breadth. This paper reports findings from interviews with practicing web design instructors in secondary and post-secondary teaching environments. We present emergent themes related to recruitment strategies, student expectations, teaching techniques, and common challenges. We find significant effort is needed to cope with mismatches between students' expectations of what web design is and the HTML/CSS syntaxoriented view of the discipline often emphasized by teachers. We conclude with implications for new teaching tools that would help better sustain student motivation while equipping them with fundamental skills in web development.},

  abstract = {As the awareness of AI's power and danger has risen, the dominant response has been a turn to ethical principles. A flood of AI guidelines and codes of ethics have been released in both the public and private sector in the last several years. However, these are meaningless principles which are contested or incoherent, making them difficult to apply; they are isolated principles situated in an industry and education system which largely ignores ethics; and they are toothless principles which lack consequences and adhere to corporate agendas. For these reasons, I argue that AI ethical principles are useless, failing to mitigate the racial, social, and environmental damages of AI technologies in any meaningful sense. The result is a gap between high-minded principles and technological practice. Even when this gap is acknowledged and principles seek to be ``operationalized,'' the translation from complex social concepts to technical rulesets is non-trivial. In a zero-sum world, the dominant turn to AI principles is not just fruitless but a dangerous distraction, diverting immense financial and human resources away from potentially more effective activity. I conclude by highlighting alternative approaches to AI justice that go beyond ethical principles: thinking more broadly about systems of oppression and more narrowly about accuracy and auditing.},

It argues that the conceptualization of inclusion/exclusion is more complex than a static, binary dichotomy of in/out and requires that we take a viewpoint that examines the changes in the dynamics of power among the stakeholders. With this viewpoint we begin to examine the balance of power between gatekeepers and gated (the entity subjected to gatekeeping). The power dynamics are manifest through processes by which transient elites (gatekeepers) emerge and mature. Contrary to traditional thinking about gatekeepers controlling the whole process, we argue that the collective patterns of behavior of the gated have a crucial role in the emergence and sustainability of gatekeepers. Fuzziness is essential to the dynamics of these processes.},

In particular, it examines the importance of task-specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and collaborative work practices for end user computing, with the goal of helping designers and programmers understand and better satisfy the needs of end users who want the capability to create, customize, and extend their applications software. The ideas in the book are based on the author's research on two successful end user programming systems - spreadsheets and CAD systems - as well as other empirical research. Nardi concentrates on broad issues in end user programming, especially end users' strengths and problems, introducing tools and techniques as they are related to higher-level user issues. Bonnie A.

While those challenges that present a predominantly technical nature have been intensely studied by researchers along the years, the ones that are concerned with qualitative, and personal aspects have not. Affinity to a programming language is one of the many personal factors that may contribute to surpass these qualitative aspects that describe the difficulties that students face. From this point-of-view, this paper presents a proposal for treating and studying programmers' affinity to programming languages as an important factor for learning computer programming. It also reports a preliminary questionnaire conducted on a master's degree class at Universidade do Minho that showed that affinity may have a broader relation to learning computer programming than anticipated. Finally, a set of relevant questions are stated to compose a future inquiry aimed at deepening the knowledge on the affinity between programmers and languages, paving the way for following research.},

If the goal is long-term change, then rewards should be avoided and other game-based elements used to create a system based on concepts of meaningful gamification.

Evidence of the productivity-enhancing effects of VET at company level is quite solid, but evidence of the effect on overall economic growth is far from conclusive. The effects on social inclusion are uncertain because reform of VET systems has not been sufficient and because it has proved difficult to bring about the necessary institutional change.

  abstract = {The evolving technological landscape in the digital era has a crucial influence on lifelong learning and the demand for problem-solving skills. In this paper, we identify associations between formal, non-formal and informal learning with sufficient problem-solving skills in technology-rich environments (TRE). We focus on adults' problem-solving skills in TRE as a novel approach to investigate formal, non-formal and informal learning based on data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies. This programme measured 16\textendash 64-year-old adults' proficiency in problem-solving skills in TRE. The total sample size was 61 654 individuals from 13 European countries. Our results clearly indicate that the skill levels of more than 50\% of adults aged 16\textendash 64 years old seem to be insufficient to cope effectively in TRE. The findings suggest that the learning ecologies of adults are a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning activities. The overall level of problem-solving skills in TRE was higher among individuals who indicated that they have participated either formal or non-formal learning activities, compared to those who have not. However, interestingly, the association between formal learning and problem-solving skills in TRE was not major. Instead, our results clearly indicate that informal learning seems to be highly associated with sufficient problem-solving skills in TRE. In practice, we outline those formal, non-formal and informal learning activities that adults perform when applying the skills in TRE. By recognising these activities undertaken by sufficient problem solvers, we can promote lifelong learning skills. Our findings can also be used as a starting point for future studies on lifelong learning.},

We introduce critical race theory and adapt it for HCI to lay a theoretical basis for race-conscious efforts, both in research and within our community. Building on the theory's original tenets, we argue that racism is pervasive in everyday socio-technical systems; that the HCI community is prone to ``interest convergence,'' where concessions to inclusion require benefits to those in power; and that the neoliberal underpinnings of the technology industry itself propagate racism. Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deepseated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist.},

However, researchers have rarely examined how technology can support an assets-based approach to these eforts, nor the implications of race, traditions, and history when creating such systems. Addressing this gap, we conducted research with two predominantly Black churches to explore health promotion design opportunities. We used photovoice, a research method where participants led their own data collection and analysis. Participants provided nuanced descriptions of the racial and ethnic identities of their communities, and how church history and aspirations for the future impacted these identities. Our fndings characterize tensions between tradition and `modernization,' implications for technology design, and the need for a temporal approach to understanding communities. We conclude with broader implications for studying the intersection of race and religion in community technology design.},

  abstract = {This article is the result of noticing the need to transpose the gatekeeping theory. Technological progress has left its mark on the media ecosystem, generating and then strengthening the convergence processes, and has also changed the understanding of gatekeeping. The architecture of new media, especially social media, places gatekeeping in the context of the network. This allows one to look at the classically understood process from a new perspective, in which the key is to base the concept on network diffusion. Contemporary gatekeeping should be analyzed in the context of such mechanisms as: information bubble, echo chamber, filtering information by users and algorithms. Basic conceptual categories, the gate and the keeper, are also modified. There is a noticeable trend towards the transformation of gatekeeping towards gatewatching, in which social media users do not create their own gates, but observe and use already existing gates. Gatekeeping in the era of social media makes the audience an important element of it, moving towards secondary gatekeeping.},

We present a novel model to account for the observed connections between SES and CS achievement. We examined possible mediating variables between SES and CS achievement, including spatial ability and access to computing. We define access as comprised of measurements of prior learning opportunities for computing, perceptions of computer science, and encouragement to pursue computing. The factors (SES, spatial ability, access to computing, and CS achievement) were measured through surveys completed by 163 students in introductory computing courses at a college level. Through the use of exploratory structural equation modeling, we found that these variables do impact each other, though not as we originally hypothesized. For our sample of students, we found spatial ability was a mediating variable for SES and CS achievement, but access to computing was not. Neither model explained all the variance, and our subject pool of US college students had higher than average SES. Our findings suggest that SES does influence success in computer science, but that relationship may not be due to access to computing education opportunities. Rather, SES might be influencing variables such as spatial ability which in turn influence CS performance.},

We apply a second level of content analysis to the development issues, identifying aspects of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that challenged students most often. Finally, we identify several computational concepts that relate to these challenges, including notation, hierarchies and paths, nesting, parameters and arguments, and decomposition and abstraction. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings for computing education.},

Our argument is that CME theory and practice need repositioning, much in the same way that Ellsworth's challenge to critical pedagogy attempted to do for that field. We conclude that to define CME using `traditional' emancipatory aims is to misread its possibilities and position as pedagogy. Instead we use the concept of `colonizers that refuse', borrowed from Memmi to illuminate some of the dilemmas critical management educators face and to think through the implications of our `Pedagogy of Refusal'.},

Unfortunately, the messiness embedded in these steps is rarely discussed or described in existing resources. In this study, we reflect on the ``messiness'' of initiating a SLR on broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Informed by two existing approaches to reflection, we used the STAARA (Situation-Task-Affect-ActionResult-Aftermath) framework to reflect on the ways in which we resolved important decisions associated with one overarching situation and several corresponding tasks, affects, actions; the aftermath is also discussed. This paper includes insights from our experience that can help other researchers navigate the initial steps of a SLR.},

  abstract = {This article presents Saul Alinsky's theory of community organizing as a democratic alternative to political realism's fixation on the coercive authority of the state and the ethical problems of statesmanship. Alinsky shows how the organizer can be used as a paradigmatic political actor in developing an approach to political ethics that treats power and self-interest as ethical concepts on which to construct a radical vision of democratic politics. His ``morality of power'' consists of learning how to use relational power and thick self-interest to develop democratic forms of deliberation and action. In contrast to the aim of the statesman, the organizer's goal is not simply to acquire power and learn how to wield it: An organizer helps the powerless learn how to use and think about power for themselves. Organizing is realist, pedagogical, and democratic, and Alinsky's ability to hold these ideas together makes him an important theorist of democratic agency in undemocratic times.},

First, unlike in previous studies, the analysis revealed explicit forms of educational content embedded in informal learning contexts in Facebook. Quizzes, case presentations and associated deliberate (e-)learning practices which are typically found in (more) formal educational settings were identified. Second, from a sociocultural learning perspective, it is shown how the participation in such virtual professional communities across national boundaries permits the announcement and negotiation of occupational status and professional identities.},

The interns' identity project is, on one hand, consequential or emerges from past activities and integrates preference, values and commitments into a coherent narrative whole. On the other hand, the identity project informs plans, preferences and orientations to future and shapes how young people create their professional and personal trajectories.},

How well they do this imitation is often used to assess their utility and to attribute humanlike (or artificial) intelligence to them. However, most work on AI refers to and relies on human intelligence without accounting for the fact that human behavior is inherently shaped by the cultural contexts they are embedded in, the values and beliefs they hold, and the social practices they follow. Additionally, since AI technologies are mostly conceived and developed in just a handful of countries, they embed the cultural values and practices of these countries. Similarly, the data that is used to train the models also fails to equitably represent global cultural diversity. Problems therefore arise when these technologies interact with globally diverse societies and cultures, with different values and interpretive practices. In this position paper, we describe a set of cultural dependencies and incongruencies in the context of AI-based language and vision technologies, and reflect on the possibilities of and potential strategies towards addressing these incongruencies.},

The 12-session prototype has been piloted with eight community college faculty. The finalized PD will be available as free, standalone web-based modules. The course includes instruction on research-based practices for recruiting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in computing. Evaluation mechanisms are developed to assess the impacts of the PD on faculty attitudes and teaching practices, and the effect of changed practices on introductory computing students' engagement and persistence. Here we report preliminary findings from interviews. The project outputs will include polished online content modules, validated student survey instruments, a classroom observation protocol, and student and faculty interview instruments.},

The lack of these skills and abilities can limit the productivity of newly hired, recent graduates, or even prevent them from gaining employment. This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment. This research is intended to assist educators in identifying areas where students may not measure up the expectations of industry companies and in improving the curriculum at their universities to better prepare them for their future careers.},

In other words, can critical dialogic processes change the social order to close the gap between a privileged class of managers and workers, or do we require class struggle and structural reform? By elaborating on such methods as dialogue, public reflection and action science, this article attempts to make the case that marginalized groups in society might find their voice in projects that are intentionally contextualized and publicly reflective. These methods have found applications in some illustrated critical pedagogies, although not without strain induced from conventional institutions. The article concludes with an enumeration of some conditions under which emancipatory discourse and liberationist struggle may coincide.},

Among the challenges regarding the transformation towards Industry 4.0 are requirements to re-skill the staff for the new work environment. The staff have to either adapt to the workplace transformation brought by digitalisation, automation and robotics or face layoffs. This paper reports on a transformation process towards Industry 4.0 which was conducted in a small manufacturing enterprise where automated assembly line, industrial robots, codes and algorithms have replaced the previous manual set-up. In order to extend the learning models from educational to workplace settings, we investi\- gated how a small manufacturing plant tackles the challenge of transfor\- mation towards Industry 4.0 with existing staff. We examined the transformation process through non-participant observations and 17 interviews during the initiation phase, and before, during, and after the new robotic system was launched. Based on the empirical study, we propose (a) a transformation method with respect to the workplace and adult learning scholarship and (b) a taxonomy of work-integrated learning activities to support the learning needed to manage transformations towards industry 4.0.},

Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework, we interview 18 Black women about their experiences navigating the computing education ecosystem. Intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three saturated sites of violence within CS education: 1. traditional K-12 classrooms; 2. predominantly White institutions; and 3. internships as supplementary learning experiences.},

In communities and societies where organisations may have replaced religious institutions as centres for adult learning, the workplace continues to respond to the universal need for community and support. These elements are related to spiritual values. Still, leaders of organisations need to consider values that underlie typical workplace activities and recognise how collective engagement and workplace interactions direct personal development and ground identity. Providing opportunities to reflect on meaning and direction at work supports a transformative approach to learning and leadership that promotes cooperative working conditions, conscious behaviour and informed citizenship through encouraging attitudes of critical awareness, praxis and collective engagement in workplace interaction.},

  abstract = {Assessment plays an important role in education and can both guide and motivate learning. Assessment can, however, be carried out with different aims: providing the students with feedback that supports the learning (formative assessment) and judging to which degree the students have fulfilled the intended learning outcomes (summative assessment). In this study, we explore the instructors' perspective on assessment within the context of introductory programming courses offered to non-computer-science majors at a public tuition-free state-funded university in a Nordic country. These courses are given to a large number of students and also employ several teaching assistants (TAs). We used constructivism as a basis for our study and investigated how instructors implement formative and summative assessments, how they view their role, and what expectations they have of their TAs in these assessments. We interviewed seven course coordinators (main instructors for introductory programming courses with additional administrative duties but without formal responsibility of the grading) and analyzed 205 course artifacts, such as syllabi, lab assignment instructions, and course material from the cross-department TA training course. The results showed that course coordinators use formative and summative assessments both separately and within the same activity. They view themselves as responsible for the assessments, as the planners and material developers, as the organizers and administrators, and as monitors of the assessments. However, the results also showed that these course coordinators delegate much of the responsibility for the assessments to their TAs and expect TAs to both grade the students and provide them with feedback and guidance. In addition, the TAs are also expected to act as informants about their students' performance. The course coordinators' role entails many different aspects, where communicating through instructions to both students and TAs is essential. We see that this implementation of assessment, with lots of responsibility distributed to the TAs, could be difficult to manage for a single faculty member who is not necessarily responsible for the grading. Based on the results, we outline some recommendations, such as offering TA training.},

To explore the potential afforded by these displays, we unobtrusively video recorded 834 museum visitor groups who stopped in front of one collection of objects. Drawing on cognitive models of curiosity, we tested three redesigns of this display, each focusing on a different strategy to spark visitor curiosity, interest, and engagement. To understand the relative effectiveness of these designs, we analyzed visitor interaction and conversation. Our results uncovered significant differences across the conditions suggesting implications for the use of such technology in museums.},

This encompasses a range of cognitive and meta-cognitive skills including generating one's own learning goals, planning how to tackle a problem, evaluating whether learning goals have been met, and re-planning based on this evaluation. The educational affordances of blogs offer opportunities for students to become self-directed learners in a supportive social environment. Based on qualitative analysis of design diaries written by 113 computer science students about a creative project, this paper presents a framework of the ways in which blogging activities can assist groups of students and their teachers in the development of a range of cognitive, social and self-directed learning skills. Although the students in this study used the commenting feature of blogs effectively for the purpose of praising and encouraging their peers, and giving hints and tips for solving problems, they did not coach each other on higher order skills. The paper discusses how this could be achieved in order to extend the educational value of blogging within a university learning community.},

Topics covered include: the historical and contemporary challenges of learning to program; aptitude tests; high dropout and failure rates; "bimodal" grade distributions; programming knowledge, strategies and mental models; the properties of novice programmers; cognitive load; taxonomies and measures of programming ability; the learning edge momentum hypothesis; teaching and learning in CS1; and open questions. Although the focus is on CS1, much of this material is relevant to any context, e.g. schools. Given the increasing demand for programmers, the move of programming into school curriculums, and the well documented challenges involved, the topics of teaching and learning programming are likely to remain of significant interest in computing education for the foreseeable future.},

  abstract = {Women-only vocational courses in technology, which became popular across Western Europe during the 1980s, had fallen from fashion by 2000. Yet the need for such courses remains, at least in certain circumstances. Drawing on case studies of two women-only courses in information and communications technology (ICT), from the Netherlands and Scotland, it is shown that building the confidence of women whose selfesteem is low is key to any successful inclusion outcomes of such courses. It is also shown that, in order to be effective, the organisation and delivery of such training must involve a `heterogeneous' package of measures. It is argued that women-only vocational training in technology, along the model presented in this article, is needed and works for particular groups of women. Women-only technology training is justified on two further grounds \textendash{} that the gender dynamics on single-sex courses are generally better for such women than those on mixed-sex courses, and that traditional associations between technology and masculinity are less likely to operate in a women-only setting. Being women-only seems to be especially important in relation to three elements of the training package: positive role model effects, mutual encouragement and support amongst trainees, and the safety to speak openly.},

Our interviewees may have less computational skill in data work, but they have extensive and varied practices to engage in data contextualization that data scientists and other full community members could learn from. In identifying the attributes of data workers on the periphery, we also hope to call attention to the challenges they face in performing data work in low resources institutions (e.g., governmental, non-profit).

This study looks at how this apparent contestation plays out in practice through a critical realist-inspired examination of practitioner discourses, specifically of those working within communities to address social vulnerabilities that we know impact upon health. The study finds that practitioners interact with the assets-based policy discourse in interesting ways. Rather than unwitting tools of neoliberalism, they considered their work to be about mitigating the worst effects of poverty and social vulnerability in ways that enhance collectivism and solidarity, concepts that neoliberalism arguably seeks to disrupt. Furthermore, rather than a different, innovative, way of working, they consider the assets-based approach to simply be a re-labelling of what they have been doing anyway, for as long as they can remember. So, for practitioners, rather than a `new' approach to public health, the assetsbased public health movement seems to be a return to recognising and appreciating the role of community within public health policy and practice; ideals that predate neoliberalism by quite some considerable time.},

As a result, highly qualified early and mid-career researchers, in particular from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, are pursuing careers outside academia. This paper advances theory and empirical research on career transitions and sustainable careers by investigating how junior academics transition into the field of data science by exploring the facilitators of their career transition and the ways in which they experience career sustainability in their new occupational field. This study relies on 28 in-depth interviews with early and mid-career STEM researchers from elite universities who decided to join a data science ``bootcamp'' to pursue a new career as data scientists. Our study reveals the career barriers that junior researchers experience in academia and how career catalysts increase their career adaptability, facilitating a career transition into sustainable careers in data science. Our study shows that career sustainability is experienced through the reaffirmation of interviewees' identity as researchers outside of academia as well as in the reconciliation between their previous career expectations and actual career outcomes after transitioning into data science.},

  abstract = {When chroniclers of technological change in the 20th century worship innovation as if it were a god, they often feel freed of the obligation to define the object of their worship. So it is with Walter Isaacson and his popular 2014 book, The Innovators, which begins with a beguiling confession by the author that innovation is ``a buzzword, drained of clear meaning.'' Rather than address the implications of the elusiveness of the innovation concept or set down the terms of his engagement with the history of computing, which is more closely the subject of his book, the authod does neither, thus squandering a chance to present himself as what he probably aspires to be: a bridge builder between the two mighty rivers of innovation studies. On the one hand, the author recounts the birth, life, and death of digital artifacts; on the other hand, he highlights the people and subcultures that shape digital innovations. But without a framework for understanding innovation, as activity and aspiration, the author squanders an opportunity to clarify the relationship between the imperatives of digital electronics and the various ways in which cultures and personalities construct and reconstruct their computers and computer networks in pursuit of human aims.},

The four projects featured in this panel bring together CS education efforts with varying methodologies focused on equity-oriented pedagogies and learning for all youth across the US. This panel will focus not only on sharing the multi-pronged efforts of the featured projects, but also on developing a shared vision among participants and panelists for what ``equity'' can and should be in the future of both SIGCSE and CS education as we celebrate SIGCSE's 50th anniversary. By highlighting the work of projects rather than individuals in this panel, audience members will have the opportunity to learn about how collaborative efforts create and examine contexts for equity in CS education across diverse stakeholders, while also providing a richer base for constructing visions of equity that go beyond mere platitudes, toward action items for broadening participation in computing.},

This poster highlights elements of the IT2017 curricular framework that help academic departments apply a competency-based approach to IT program development. Although competencies are prevalent in many areas of professional practice, placing competencies at the center of IT curriculum development requires rethinking of how we design learning environments in which students achieve IT competencies.

However, more work is needed to understand how PA trackers are perceived and adopted by low-SES families, where PA may be deprioritized due to economic stresses, limited resources, and perceived crime. Accordingly, we conducted a twomonth, in-depth qualitative study, exploring low-SES caregivers' perspectives on PA tracking and promotion. Our findings show how PA tracking was impacted by caregivers' attitudes toward safety, which were influenced by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional processes. We conclude that PA tracking tools for low-SES families should help caregivers and children to experience and celebrate progress.},

We describe an enhanced method of characterizing the end user population, based on categorizing end users according to the ways they represent abstractions. Since the use of abstraction can facilitate or impede achieving key software engineering goals (such as improving reusability and maintainability), this categorization promises an improved ability to highlight niches of end users with special software engineering capabilities or struggles. We have incorporated this approach into an in-progress survey of end user programming practices.},

The original context and method which generated this number had two weaknesses, both of which we address. First, it relies on undocumented, judgment-based factors to estimate the number of end user programmers based on the total number of end users; we address this weakness by identifying specific end user sub-populations and then estimating their sizes. Second, Boehm's estimate relies on additional undocumented, judgment-based factors to adjust for rising computer usage rates; we address this weakness by integrating fresh Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data and projections as well as a richer estimation method. With these improvements to Boehm's method, we estimate that in 2012 there will be 90 million end users in American workplaces. Of these, we anticipate that over 55 million will use spreadsheets or databases (and therefore may potentially program), while over 13 million will describe themselves as programmers, compared to BLS projections of fewer than 3 million professional programmers. We have validated our improved method by generating estimates for 2001 and 2003, then verifying that our estimates are consistent with existing estimates from other sources.},

Where some have suggested that critical scholars should align their use of the term with its common definition in professional computer science, I argue that we should instead approach algorithms as ``multiples''\textemdash unstable objects that are enacted through the varied practices that people use to engage with them, including the practices of ``outsider'' researchers. This approach builds on the work of Laura Devendorf, Elizabeth Goodman, and Annemarie Mol. Different ways of enacting algorithms foreground certain issues while occluding others: computer scientists enact algorithms as conceptual objects indifferent to implementation details, while calls for accountability enact algorithms as closed boxes to be opened. I propose that critical researchers might seek to enact algorithms ethnographically, seeing them as heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical systems, rather than rigidly constrained and procedural formulas. To do so, I suggest thinking of algorithms not ``in'' culture, as the event occasioning this essay was titled, but ``as'' culture: part of broad patterns of meaning and practice that can be engaged with empirically. I offer a set of practical tactics for the ethnographic enactment of algorithmic systems, which do not depend on pinning down a singular ``algorithm'' or achieving ``access,'' but which rather work from the partial and mobile position of an outsider.},

  abstract = {The increasingly precarious nature of North America's labour market has created challenges for young adults in securing and maintaining adequate employment. In a study to better understand these barriers, one-to-one interviews and focus groups were conducted with 36 young adults (between ages 18 and 29) in a neighborhood in Toronto, Canada. Findings show that varying forms of discrimination experienced and perceived by young job seekers, along with expectations of employers within current labour markets, act as key barriers to successful labour market attachment. The findings suggest that the challenges to attach to the labour market can have a lasting psychosocial impact on young people. Consequently, the negative socio-cultural perceptions of young adults and those that hold them, in conjunction with the precariousness of a labour market that supports and maintains social inequality, must be addressed through more substantive policy, regulatory and program based initiatives.},

The process of enhancing an employee's present and future effectiveness is development. IT industry is one of the most challenging industries for employees to work and survive due to fast coming changes and challenges. Employees have danger of being obsolete. They have to continually involve in learning and developing their competencies, skills, knowledge, ability etc. This is equally challenging for the companies too as they face challenges of competition from abroad (from China, Philippines), high attrition rate, shortage of quality and employable talent, rising cost, management, customer service, security, inflation, introducing better software, services in the market. Here comes the role of an organisation to provide healthy HRD climate so that employees can produce the best output. The purpose of this research paper is to study the present HRD climate prevailing in IT companies. This study is done on the basis of certain demographic details of the employees. The demographic details used in the study are gender, education, designation, experience, age, income. The results indicate that the most of the employees perceive the HRD climate of their companies satisfactorily.},

Study participants were recruited from a GED and job readiness center serving Baltimore youth. Study results offer a nuanced understanding of the patterning and mental health consequences of police violence for young Black men. Participant disclosures of witnessing and experiencing police violence began in childhood and spanned through emerging adulthood, met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\textendash Fifth Edition criteria for trauma exposure, and embodied theoretical conceptualizations of racial trauma. Exposures to police violence fostered distrust of police and informed participants' appraisals of their vulnerability to police violence across the life course. Six study participants disclosed losing loved ones to police killings. Injustice and hypervigilance accompanied grief. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.},

Jensen found that the use of mobile phones to share market price information made \textordfeminine sh markets more ef\textordfeminine cient, while also improving producer and consumer welfare. Based on our own ethnographic case study in the region, we examine the historical, geographic, and political-economic conditions in which Jensen's \textordfeminine ndings hold. We show that north Kerala's coastal geography and prevalent credit relationships make it a special case of \textordfeminine sh trading where \textordfeminine shers had the \textordmasculine exibility to optimize pro\textordfeminine ts by selling at different markets. Fishers' ability to leverage mobile phones for sharing price information derived from this \textordmasculine exibility. Moreover, we found a broader de\textordfeminine nition of welfare at play that went beyond increased income. Those working in various roles in Kerala's \textordfeminine shing industry emphasized a spectrum of bene\textordfeminine ts from phone use, including maintaining trade relations, facilitating coordination, and protecting themselves during times of risk, vulnerability, or emergency. We suggest that parsimonious models, such as Jensen's, can generate blind spots, which are problematic when such studies are used to draw broader conclusions about policy and technology design.},

The projects illustrate how communities have skills and assets within themselves which they can bring to bear in a social marketing framework, making it possible to apply social marketing on modest budgets, and how interventions which originate within communities and are owned by them may be more engaging and may lead to more positive health outcomes. Approaches which genuinely involve communities in development and implementation make financial, practical, and philosophical sense.},

Historically, inventors have created language products for a wide variety of reasons, from attempts at making domain specific tasks easier or technical achievements, to economic, social, or political reasons. As a consequence, the modern programming language industry now has a large variety of incompatible programming languages, each of which with unique syntax, semantics, toolsets, and often their own standard libraries, lifetimes, and costs. In this paper, we suggest that the programming language wars, a term which describes the broad divergence and impact of language designs, including often pseudo-scientific claims made that they are good or bad, may be negatively impacting the world.

Employment in this sector is projected to grow 12\% between 2018 and 2028, which is faster than the average of all other occupations. Published data are available on traditional non-computer science-specific hiring processes. However, the hiring process for CS majors may be different. It is critical to have up-to-date information on questions such as ``what positions are in high demand for CS majors?,'' ``what is a typical hiring process?,'' and ``what do employers say they look for when hiring CS graduates?'' This article discusses the analysis of a survey of 218 recruiters hiring CS graduates in the United States. We used Atlas.ti to analyze qualitative survey data and report the results on what positions are in the highest demand, the hiring process, and the resume review process. Our study revealed that a software developer was the most common job the recruiters were looking to fill. We found that the hiring process steps for CS graduates are generally aligned with traditional hiring steps, with an additional emphasis on technical and coding tests. Recruiters reported that their hiring choices were based on reviewing resume's experience, GPA, and projects sections. The results provide insights into the hiring process, decision making, resume analysis, and some discrepancies between current undergraduate CS program outcomes and employers' expectations.},

At the same time, however, the rhetoric of innovation and revolution surrounding this moment in database development obscures the ways it helped concentrate and extend particular kinds of racialized power and, in particular, whiteness (i.e., those norms and values congenial to the reproduction of white racial dominance and the subjugation of blackness). In this article, we revisit key works of the database revolution to show how they encoded whiteness as a kind of unremarked optimum, in both implicit and explicit ways. Finally, we argue that these developments helped to codify and extend a kind of ``willful ignorance'' that, as scholars of epistemology and justice have shown, is central to the preservation and reproduction of whiteness.},

Government policy reports, from around the world, set out plans to address computing skills shortages by introducing additional education or training programmes [23]. In the UK, this is put forward as a key goal of the new higher level apprenticeships, including Graduate Apprenticeships in Scotland and Degree Apprenticeships in the rest of the UK. These are promoted as bridging the skills gap by involving employers in curriculum design and widening access to people who would not want to study towards a traditional degree, because of the financial burden or time out of employment. New graduate apprentices at three Scottish universities were encouraged to complete a short survey, asking about their route into the degree, including their aspirations, motivations, and previous experience. Most respondents had begun an IT career before they started the apprenticeship and were upskilling and gaining an internationally recognised qualification. A third could be considered new to IT, including those coming straight from school and those moving into IT mid-career. The apprentices' primary motivation was to gain skills. They chose the apprenticeship, rather than a traditional degree, because of the integration of work experience, followed by financial reasons: graduate apprentices earn salaries and can avoid student debt. These apprenticeships create a new route to a computing degreelevel qualification. We consider their potential in addressing digital skills shortages.},

We identify and discuss four key factors that establish a sense of coherence using Lave and Wenger's `Communities of Practice' lens: the interdependence of activities, characteristics of the space, social relationships through peer learning, and community rules and expectations. We contribute to the discussion on new configurations of personal making and industrial production, and advocate for extending conceptualisations of hackerspaces to be more inclusive of hybrid organisations that serve the needs of people from low socioeconomic communities.},

If global IT work is painted mainly as outsourcing IT-infused work from developed countries to poorer countries (euphemistically referred to as ``low income countries''), shouldn't the development of capabilities in these very same less-developed countries be a vital cog? Simply put, if these countries do not have a capable workforce, IT work, or any other work for that matter, cannot be outsourced to these countries. The question then is how can capabilities be developed in developing countries? In this research-in-progress paper, we address this question by examining a case of an activist-led initiative in Nepal called ``Open Learning Exchange'' (OLE in short) that used the capabilities of ICTs to deliver quality education to remote mountainous regions of Nepal. We collected data through interviews and group sessions as well as observations and document analyses. We are currently analyzing the data at both the micro and macro levels. At the micro level, we are using models from the IS training literature to gain an understanding of how training concepts developed in the West can explain the success of the initiative. Then we move to the macro level by shifting our interpretive gaze to the concept of ``eco-system'' in order to understand the role of the society and the surroundings in the implementation of capability building initiatives in developing countries and sustaining them.},

From a case study of a unique organization whose purpose is to facilitate strategic knowledge distillation, it was found that this process is characterized by targeted information gathering that relies on diverse experts for interpretation as well as validation. It also embodies the organizational capability to leverage information technologies in the distillation effort, integrating them with processes for generating, storing, and transporting rich, de-embedded knowledge across multiple levels of the organization. As a result of the case study, a model of the strategic learning is developed and a series of propositions regarding its context and processes are presented based on this model. The model highlights key dimensions of strategic learning that suggest design parameters for organizations building strategic learning systems.},

  abstract = {In teaching social justice, educators draw from a diverse array of theoretical approaches. In so doing, analytically distinct concepts can get conflated, which significantly impacts student learning, particularly as they relate to teachers' social justice goals. Using ethnography, this paper examines how a social justice educator mobilized a Freirean pedagogical approach to teach students about their positionalities, and how this resulted in the conflation of identity and positionality. In particular, I examine how a social justice educator's practices led students to understand positionality as identity, and to see identity as a fixed and essentialized personal characteristic, rather than a socially constructed power relationship. Ironically, this led students, particularly students from positionalities of relative privilege, to reject the instructor's call for students to participate in social action because they understood themselves to be defined by their identities, rather than by their actions. This paper contributes to the literature in social justice education by: (1) highlighting how the mobilization and conflation of analytically distinct concepts \textendash{} in this case, identity and positionality \textendash{} impacted student learning; (2) illustrating how the conflation of identity and positionality resulted in essentialized notions of identity that negatively impacted students' commitment to social action; and (3) arguing for a more intentional, historicized focus on positionality for social justice educators.},

Instead of starting with specific values or goals, we instead begin by considering various desired endpoints of computing instruction and then work backward to reason about what form learning activities might take and what are the underlying values and principles that support learners in reaching these endpoints. The result of this exercise is a push for rethinking the form of contemporary computing education with an eye toward more diverse, equitable and meaningful endpoints. With a focus on the role that constructionist-\-focused pedagogies and designs can play in supporting these endpoints, we examine four distinct cases and the endpoints they support. This paper is not intended to encompass all the possible alternate endpoints for computer science education; rather, this work seeks to start a conversation around the nature of and need for alternate endpoints, as a means to re-\-evaluate the current tools and curricula to prepare learners for a future of active and empowered computing-\-literate citizens.},

In this paper, I apply a critical theory perspective drawing from the work of Jurgen Habermas to show that workplace spirituality movement has emerged in response to the loss of meanings inherent in neoliberal capitalism. However, since this movement is operating on a logic of performativity and instrumental rationality, it represents an attempt to re-orient individual subjectivity and the spiritual realm of human experience to serve capitalism.},

With CS rapidly emerging as a distinct feature of K\textendash 12 public education in the United States, calls to expand CS education are often linked to equity and diversity concerns around expanding access to girls and historically underrepresented students of color. Yet, unlike other critical traditions in education research, equity-oriented CS research has largely failed to interrogate the sociopolitical context of CS education. To move toward a justice-centered approach to equity, Vakil argues, we must simultaneously attend to at least three features of CS education: the content of curriculum, the design of learning environments, and the politics and purposes of CS education reform. While there are many avenues of critical inquiry within and across each of these topics, the focus in this essay is on the role of ethics in the curriculum, the role of identity in CS learning environments, and the significance of a clear political vision for CS education.},

In this article, we propose that learning's relationship to worker well-being may be more complicated. We posit that learning can become a burden (instead of always being a benefit) in occupations that are learning intensive and tightly associated with the postindustrial economy. Results of analyses using data from the General Social Survey suggest that learning lessens work\textendash family conflict by increasing job satisfaction, but at the same time, learning makes work\textendash family conflict worse by leading people to work longer hours and exacerbating work-related stress.},

  abstract = {Programming is everywhere, and is becoming an increasingly essential component of knowledge work outside the realms of traditional software development. Examples include data journalism, scientific computing, machine control, machine learning, financial management, and others. A key aspect of this trend is that users have to use programming tools, but typically lack programming education, let alone a computer science background. In this short paper we revisit potential assumptions and preconceptions underlying traditional programming system design, from the perspective of practicing scientists using tools like MATLAB, R, Bash, Python, C++, and others. Specifically, we aim to peel off some ingrained assumptions that have informed programming language and system design for decades. Without giving a lot of answers, we hope some of our contrarian observations may turn out to be controversial, and stimulate a meaningful discussion towards a better programmer experience in the domain of science.},

The inner loop can also assess the student's evolving competence and update a student model, which is used by the outer loop to select a next task that is appropriate for the student. For those who know little about tutoring systems, this description is meant as a demystifying introduction. For tutoring system experts, this description illustrates that although tutoring systems differ widely in their task domains, user interfaces, software structures, knowledge bases, etc., their behaviors are in fact quite similar.},

In this perspective paper, we discuss characteristics of health-related interventions known to produce IGI, explain why health informatics interventions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon, and describe safeguards that can be implemented to improve health equity. We provide examples in which health informatics interventions produced inequality because they were more accessible to, heavily used by, adhered to, or effective for those from socioeconomically advantaged groups. We provide a brief outline of precautions that intervention developers and implementers can take to guard against creating or worsening inequality through health informatics. We conclude by discussing evaluation approaches that will ensure that IGIs are recognized and studied.},

Rather than suggesting that actors are hemmed in or incapacitated by multiple infrastructural commitments, inclusions, and exclusions, I show instead how they work artfully to align them in ways concordant with membership and how this produces both consequences for their work and opportunities for analysis.},

After reviewing various perspectives on making as educative practice, they present a framework that treats the following principles as starting points for equity-oriented research and design: critical analyses of educational injustice; historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity; explicit attention to pedagogical philosophies and practices; and ongoing inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making. These principles are grounded in their own research and teaching in the Tinkering Afterschool Program as well as in the insights and questions raised by critical voices both inside and outside the maker movement.},

We carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. Among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. However, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. Our findings point to design opportunities in HCI to invent learnercentered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.},

Through their coaching, these leadership coaches were able to help Black leaders build their capacities and improve their performance.

  abstract = {Due to economic inequality in society, millions of Latinx high school youth work after-school jobs and summer jobs in order to provide additional income for their families. The purpose of this qualitative study, conducted with transnational Latinx youth, was to identify the engineering-related skills and bodies of knowledge they developed and applied while in different workplaces. This study is framed in complementary theories of funds of knowledge, Vygotskian theories of mediated action, and theories of resistant capital. Specifically, this study is based in the premise that youth can develop engineeringrelated funds of knowledge through tool-mediated, goal-directed activities jointly conducted with family members and others, and that workplaces can be important sites for the development of funds of knowledge. Workplace activities are situated within sociohistorical contexts in which Latinx workers are often exploited and thus mobilize forms of resistance. A multiple case study was conducted with 20 transnational Latinx youth who currently or previously worked one or more jobs to supplement family income. Data sources included workplace observations, occupational interviews, and semi-structured interviews. We first divided the data by category of business ownership (family-owned businesses versus corporate-owned businesses) to explore whether different types of workplaces, characterized by different hierarchical relations, fostered different types of skills and bodies of knowledge. Constant comparative analytic methods were used to describe the engineering-related bodies of knowledge and skills, including critical resistant skills, that the youths applied in the context of workplace activities. Across different occupations, all youth developed and applied knowledge and skills related to industrial and operations engineering, including the iterative development of processes designed to maximize efficiency and to promote health and safety. While applying funds of knowledge toward their employers' goals, they also applied these funds of knowledge to make counter-spaces that were more humane, and they expanded technical processes to include a deep consideration of the emotions and well-being of people and animals. Ultimately, the youth mobilized and hoped to mobilize these funds of knowledge and forms of resistance toward more humane workplaces, better living conditions in their homes and communities, and more economically secure futures for themselves and their families. This study does not romanticize exploitative economic conditions experienced by suggesting that Latinx youths' workplace experiences are positive, but it offers better understandings of the wide range of complex and rich engineering-related funds of knowledge developed in the context of different workplace activities. Educators who understand and recognize these funds of knowledge as assets may be able to design more equitable learning environments that position working youth as experts and core contributors. Educational implications include recognizing youths' workplace experiences as epistemological resources, and critiquing and transforming systems through expanded visions of engineering. These visions of engineering can include but extend beyond the design of physical technologies, to encompass the design of interacting processes, technologies, and systems. Ultimately this type of education could repurpose workplacederived funds of knowledge (from serving employers or corporations) toward more equitable futures (serving youths' personal trajectories and communities).},

This leads to the following question: can end users be enticed to enter assertions? To investigate this question, we have devised a curiosity-centered approach to eliciting assertions from end users, built on a surprise-explain-reward strategy. Our follow-up work with end-user participants shows that the approach is effective in encouraging end users to enter assertions that help them find errors.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) offline cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability.The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

Increasingly, HCI scholars are proposing assets-based design as an effective approach towards this issue. Rather than starting from people's needs and deficits, this approach posits that design should start from a deep understanding of people's assets. A pending issue, however, is how to account for the situated nature of assets; that is, how to decide which asset to leverage and for what design purpose. Drawing from cultural sociology and shifting the emphasis from assets to capacities, we propose Swidler's theory of culture-in-action as an analytical lens for unpacking the complex relationship between capacities, goals, and structural limitations. Leveraging findings from a Participatory Design engagement with 35 Latino immigrant parents for envisioning parent-education technologies, we demonstrate the applicability of this lens. We contribute to HCI scholarship by further discussing 1) how to analyze capacities' design potential, and 2) the methodological particularities for collecting them.},

A growing body of CSCW and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, building upon education and community development literature, argues that centering on needs dismisses marginalized users' capacity for driving change. Needs-based views often lead to designs for the ``here and now,'' further marginalizing populations and perpetuating stereotypes. In contrast, an assets-based approach that puts users' knowledge, strengths, and capacities\textemdash assets\textemdash at the core of design can better promote sustained impact. Translating assets into meaningful designs that interact with intersecting systems of oppression, however, raises critical questions: What are assets? Whose assets are privileged? What ethical considerations surface when facilitating assets-based reflections? How can an assets-based design tackle systems-level problems? In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and industry actors to explore the implications of assets-based perspectives across domains, including Education, Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD), and Participatory Design (PD). Specifically, we will work to develop guidelines and methodologies for CSCW researchers and designers to identify when and how to pursue an assets-based approach, navigating issues of power to translate assets into design effectively.},

  abstract = {The field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has long recognized a socio-technical gap complicating the design of technologies that can sustainably meet social needs. In response, a growing body of research advocates for assets-based design, an approach that seeks to build upon what the individuals and community already have. The emphasis on positioning assets rather than needs at the center of the process can complicate designers' decisions on what activities to foster, how to conduct them, and what outcomes to expect. In this paper, we reflect on two different assets-based design endeavors with vulnerable populations. Our reflections present assets-based design as an ongoing process that prioritizes the formation and evolution of a collective of assets-based thinkers who continually learn about their assets and ways to use them to attain desirable change. From that reflection, we contribute three methodological commitments for assets-based design to the growing CSCW scholarship on supporting vulnerable communities to attain emancipatory transformations: (1) embedding trust-building elements throughout the journey; (2) facilitating the formation of an interdependent collective; and (3) making moves towards incremental transformations. Further, we contribute a discussion on the change of perspective that entails for researchers and designers interested in undertaking assets-based design. In particular, we underscore the need to recognize the value of work before the work, to see technology as an intermediary rather than an inevitable end, and embrace impact in the shape of slow incremental transformation.},

  abstract = {Background. Assessing a software engineer's ability to solve algorithmic programming tasks has been an essential part of technical interviews at some of the most successful technology companies for several years now. We do not know to what extent individual characteristics, such as personality or programming experience, predict the performance in such tasks. Decision makers' unawareness of possible predictor variables has the potential to bias hiring decisions which can result in expensive false negatives as well as in the unintended exclusion of software engineers with actually desirable characteristics. Methods. We conducted an exploratory quantitative study with 32 software engineering students to develop an empirical theory on which individual characteristics predict the performance in solving coding challenges. We developed our theory based on an established taxonomy framework by Gregor (2006). Results. Our findings show that the better coding challenge solvers also have better exam grades and more programming experience. Furthermore, conscientious as well as sad software engineers performed worse in our study. We make the theory available in this paper for empirical testing. Discussion. The theory raises awareness to the influence of individual characteristics on the outcome of technical interviews. Should the theory find empirical support in future studies, hiring costs could be reduced by selecting appropriate criteria for preselecting candidates for on-site interviews and potential bias in hiring decisions could be reduced by taking suitable measures.},

We use mixed methods, which include eld notes, surveys, and focus groups to investigate whether asset data can be mobilized by the community itself, rather than by sta , to address its challenges and, if so, possible strategies for community members to utilize such data. Our three ndings include: 1. refugees in our study had the capacity to collect and up-and-download asset data, 2. However, they lack technical and statistical skills to utilize the data most e ectively, and 3. Nevertheless, the process of collecting data contributed to a sense of community at the classroom level.

This work clusters the behavioral patterns of users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles. Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, this research identified eleven roles that members occupy, such as welcomer and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics, including how roles change over members' lifecycles, and how roles predict long-term participation in the community. We found that members frequently change roles over their history, from ones that seek resources to ones offering help, while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of community-building efforts.},

Findings from this study provide guidance and suggestions to women who are interested in transitioning to computing later in their career paths.
